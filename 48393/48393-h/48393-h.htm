<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE have been occasions, even in this greatest
of world’s conflicts, when</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Grim-visag’d war hath smoothed his
wrinkled front,”</p></div>

<p class='unindent'>and stopped fighting long enough to smile.</p>

<p>It could not be all slaughter and struggle, this
war, or every combatant on the long, weary battle-line
would go mad. There must be relaxation from
the terrible tension. And there is.</p>

<p>Human nature proves to be much the same in time
of stress as under more cheerful circumstances, and
the lads at the front, in the trenches, and even in
the hospitals, as well as the sad-hearted folks left
behind, are quick to catch at any incident, however
trivial, that shall relieve the strain by a suggestion
of mirthfulness; a mild paliative for the awfulness of
things as they are.</p>

<p>In all wars there are amusing happenings; still
but few are ever recorded, so overshadowed are they
by more momentous matters. And now, while shrapnel
and gas-bombs are still fouling the European air
and tremendous events that make history for a whole
world are being enacted daily, seems the most fitting
time to gather such material as the European press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
affords, to exhibit the lighter side of the world’s most
dreadful war.</p>

<p>This is the first and so far the only collection of
its kind published since the war began. In its compilation
care has been taken to avoid all items calculated
to give offense to any. The bitterness and
hatred that characterize much of the current offerings,
especially of the German and British press, are
given no place here, for reasons that must be obvious.</p>

<p>The absence or scarcity of anecdotes from Russian,
Japanese, Polish, Turkish, Bulgarian, Serbian and
Italian sources may be attributed to the editor’s inability
at this time to secure access to suitable material,
if such exists at all, and not to any wish to limit
selections solely to the other combatants.</p>

<h2>ANECDOTES OF THE
GREAT WAR</h2>


<h3>BLANKETY-BLANK</h3>

<p>Mrs. Waring—“What language do the Belgians
use, Paul?”</p>

<p>Mr. Waring—“I don’t know; but I know what language
I’d use if I were a Belgian!”</p>


<h3>HAS A MONOPOLY</h3>

<p>“How is it that nobody ever ventures to discuss the
war with Jinks, and he has all the talking to himself?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, he’s the only fellow in the club
who knows how to pronounce the names of those Russian
and Polish jawbreaker towns.”</p>


<h3>MERE TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR</h3>

<p>The proprietor of a café at Havre, in endeavoring
to please his large-increased British clientèle, as a
consequence of the war, started his menus in English.
The first effort of the local printer was:—</p>

<p>“Soup, fish, entrée, joint, sweet, wife and coffee
included.”</p>

<p>Three francs was the price, and one might say not
at all dear at that figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>


<h3>FIGHT OR I QUIT YOU</h3>

<p>Mabel—“I think I shall give up my flat next
week.”</p>

<p>Maud—“Why, is it too small?”</p>

<p>Mabel—“No; he won’t enlist.”</p>


<h3>WOULDN’T BACK OUT</h3>

<p>One night General —— was out on the line
and observed a light on the mountain opposite. Thinking
it was a signal-light of the enemy, he remarked
to his artillery officer that a hole could easily be put
through it. Whereupon the officer, turning to the
corporal in charge of the gun, said:</p>

<p>“Corporal, do you see that light?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Put a hole through it,” ordered the captain.</p>

<p>The corporal sighted the gun, and, when all was
ready, he looked up and said:</p>

<p>“Captain, that’s the moon.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care for that,” was the captain’s ready response;
“put a hole through it, anyhow.”</p>


<h3>UNDER CANVAS</h3>

<p>“Yes,” sighed the mother, “I am so often worried
about my boy John. You have no idea how much
concerned a mother is when her son is on the tented
field.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the sympathetic listener. “And what
regiment is your son with?”</p>

<p>“Regiment? Oh, he isn’t with the army—he’s employed
in a traveling circus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>


<h3>PUNCTURED</h3>

<p>“Reckon I look a reg’lar Bluebird,” quoth Tommy
to himself, as he caught a khaki reflection of himself
in a looking-glass.</p>

<p>On going nearer he gazed at the rough stubble of
his chin ruefully, and took a thoughtful look at his
watch.</p>

<p>“Just time,” he muttered, as he pushed open the
door of an unknown barber’s shop.</p>

<p>That worthy, with patriotic fervor, placed himself
at the disposal of Tommy absolutely, and, between
various tricky questions on points of war, nicked and
gashed the poor soldier’s face with consummate skill.</p>

<p>The job finished, the barber surveyed Tommy with
pride and admiration as he flicked him down with a
towel. Our hero, however, again went and surveyed
his face in the glass.</p>

<p>“Give me a drink of water!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“You ain’t going to faint?” exclaimed the alarmed
hairdresser.</p>

<p>“No—oh, no,” calmly replied Tommy, staunching
the wounds on his face. “I just want to see if my
mouth’ll hold water!”</p>


<h3>HE WANTED POTATOES</h3>

<p>A section of British infantry entered a French village
in the evening and were going to billet for the
night, so many thought it a good chance to cook a
hot supper. A private had foraged round and found
everything to make a good Irish stew except the potatoes.
Being unable to speak French, he asked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
section commander what was the French for potatoes.
The section commander, being a bit of a wit and
scenting some fun, replied, “Bon soir” (“Good
evening”).</p>

<p>The private in perfect good faith went up to a
house door and was answered by a Frenchwoman, who
did not understand one word of English, and the following
conversation occurred:</p>

<p>Private—“Bon soir.”</p>

<p>Frenchwoman—“Bon soir, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Private—“Yes, bon soir.”</p>

<p>Frenchwoman—“Bon soir, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Private—“Yes, yes! Some bon soirs, please.”</p>

<p>Thomas Atkins, seeing the look of amazement on
the good Frenchwoman’s face, and seeing a potato
lying in the roadway, thought he had better adopt
different tactics, so, picking up the potato and showing
it to the woman, said: “Here, missus, give us
some of these blooming spuds!”</p>


<h3>ABSENT-MINDED BEGGAR</h3>

<p>The “Tommy” on leave from the front had been
given a free railway pass to take him home to see his
people, and he utilized part of his brief holiday to get
married. On the return journey, when the ticket-inspector
asked to see his pass, he produced by accident
his marriage lines.</p>

<p>The inspector handed the paper back with a glimmer
of a smile.</p>

<p>“This is a ticket for a very long and wearisome
journey, young man,” he said, “but not on this line.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>


<h3>AND THE TOOTUNS, TOO</h3>

<p>First Native—“We’re doin’ fine at the war, Jarge.”</p>

<p>Second Native—“Yes, Jahn; and so be they
Frenchies.”</p>

<p>First Native—“Aye; an’ so be they Belgians an’
Italyuns an’ Rooshians.”</p>

<p>Second Native—“Aye; an’ so be they Allys. Oi
dunno where they come from, Jahn, but they be perfect
fiends for fightin’.”</p>


<h3>WAR BRIDE RETORTS</h3>

<p>Soldier’s Unmarried Wife (who has been living
with her man for eleven years, to charming and aristocratic
widow, the local representative of the Soldiers’
and Sailors’ Families’ Association)—“Well,
ma’am, I am going to be married next week, and I
want you to come to the wedding. You’ve been so
kind it would not be right without you.”</p>

<p>Fair Widow—“I shall be delighted to come, Mrs.
Brown. What day is it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown—“On Thursday, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Fair Widow—“That is very unfortunate. I am
afraid I cannot go, as I have another important engagement.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown—“Is it very important, ma’am? Can’t
you put it off?”</p>

<p>Fair Widow—“Well, the truth is, I am going to
be married myself.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown—“Ah, I quite understand. It doesn’t
do to miss the chance of getting righted when you
gets the opportunity, does it now, ma’am?”</p>

<h3>SOME BOSS</h3>

<p>How Lord Kitchener is regarded in the English
army was shown once in amusing fashion at a “geographical
tea-party.”</p>

<p>It was noticed that a young subaltern came into
the room with a tiny portrait of Lord Kitchener in
his buttonhole. No one could guess what geographical
significance could be attached to it. At last the
young man explained that what he had intended to
convey was “The Bos-phor-us.”</p>


<h3>WHAT MUFFS ARE FOR</h3>

<p>“You are a regular muff, sir,” said an exasperated
sergeant, after vainly trying to drill a recruit.</p>

<p>“Thank you sir,” replied the latter; “if I am a
muff, I have done my duty—I have made you warm!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<h3>GOING THE LIMIT</h3>

<p>Even the war has its bright side. Two negro porters
were discussing it as they waited for a train to
pull into the station.</p>

<p>“Man,” said the first, “dem Germany submaroons
is sho’ly gwine to sink de British navy. Yas, sir-ee,
dey’s sho’ly gwine to ’splode dem naval boats dat’s
waitin’ out yonda.”</p>

<p>“Sho!” said porter number two. “An’ what’s
gwine ter happen den?”</p>

<p>“Why, dem Germany submaroons’ll come right on
’cross de ocean an’ splode de rest ob de naval boats ob
de world. Dat’s what’ll happen den, Sambo!”</p>

<p>“Well, looky heah, Gawge. Ain’t yo’ an’ me better
decla’ ouahselves a couple o’ noot—nootral—nootralities?”</p>

<p>“Man,” said Gawge, “yo’ all kin be a nootrality
if yo’ wants to. Ah’m a German!”</p>


<h3>TOMMY ATKINS EXPLAINS WHY “IT’S A
LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY”</h3>

<p>Scene: A street in a French town. Enter Thomas
Atkins, singing; he meets Jean Pioupiou.</p>

<p>T. A.—“‘It’s a long, long way to Tipperary, it’s—’
Halloa, cocky—how goes it?” (Holds out his
hand, genially.)</p>

<p>J. P.—“<i>Ah, mon cher ami!</i> ‘For eeze a zholi good
fellow,’ <i>nest-ce-pas?</i>” (Attempts to embrace his new
friend.)</p>

<p>T. A.—“Whoa, mare—steady on! You make me
blush, old sport—it’s not the thing where we come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
from. Kiss the girls—not half! But the men—not
in <i>these!</i>”</p>

<p>J. P.—“You come from Teeperary—a long, long
way, <i>peut-être?</i>”</p>

<p>T. A.—“Me? Never was there in the whole course
of my natural, <i>cher ami, see voo play, mong cher
frère</i>. What price my <i>parley-vooing</i>, eh?”</p>

<p>J. P.—“<i>Charmant—charmant! Vous parlerez
bientôt</i>—”</p>

<p>T. A.—“Cut it, old dear; I like you—you’re hot
stuff; but your queer langwidge is a bit too thick.
Have a fag? No offense.”</p>

<p>J. P.—“<i>Merci bien, m’sieu. Mais dites-moi—tiens!</i>
Tell me, eef you please, where is zis Teeperary, and
why you sing always of it such a ’long, long way?’
Ees it that you all come from there?”</p>

<p>T. A.-“Well, I never met anybody yet who’d been
there, but I’ll tell you one thing—promise you won’t
let on?”</p>

<p>J. P.—“‘Let on?’ Pardon—I do not—”</p>

<p>T. A.—“You won’t tell anyone?”</p>

<p>J. P.—“<i>Ah, non, non—pas un mot!</i>”</p>

<p>T. A.—(Whispers hoarsely) “It’s in Ireland.”</p>

<p>J. P. (Ecstatically) “Ah—Teeperary ees in Ireland!
Eet is the Hymne National of <i>les Irlandais
sans doute;</i> the—what do you say—the National Anthem
of that country!”</p>

<p>T. A.—(Rather taken aback) “Well, not exactly a
<i>hymn</i>, my son. You’re a long way off it yet.”</p>

<p>J. P.—“‘A long, long way’ off eet, <i>hein?</i> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
why so very far to this place you sing of? And why
do you celebrate it so loudly on your marching?”</p>

<p>T. A.—(Puzzled) “Blowed if I know. It’s a long
way because—you see, you’d have to cross the Channel;
then first on the left and straight on till you board
the Irish packet; then—ask a policeman. See?”</p>

<p>J. P.—(Sadly) “<i>Ah, oui, oui. Je ne comprends pas—mille
regrets.</i>”</p>

<p>T. A.—“You no comprenny, eh? Same here—left
my geography home on the piano, else I’d put it
clearer.” (An idea comes to him.) “You see, it’s
like this: we take Tipperary as kind of representative—oh,
<i>very</i> hot. Now I’m oratin’. Twig?”</p>

<p>J. P.—“<i>Pardon?</i>”</p>

<p>T. A.—(Very earnestly, explaining to himself as
well as his friend) “Means lots of things, Tipperary—home,
the girl, a square feed, plenty of ’baccy, and
the old pals, you know; all signified by the word ‘Tipperary.’
Understand? We pack it up tight for convenience
in transport, and when we sing it, it all comes
out—the jolly things we’ve left behind. Got it?”</p>

<p>J. P.—(Smiling happily) “<i>Ah, bien entendu</i>—you
‘pack it’—ze Irish packet of which you have spoke,
is it not?”</p>

<p>T. A.—(Groaning softly) “Oh, Lord! Cheese it,
Frenchie—you make me perspire. What I mean is,
when we <i>sing</i> ‘Tipperary’ it <i>reminds</i> us of all these
things. And we like it. Makes us feel nice all over.”</p>

<p>J. P.—(Joyously) “<i>Voilà—comme c’est bon—c’est
symbolique, un coup de l’imagination, n’est-ce-pas?</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>T. A.—(Catching the word) “That’s it—you’ve
struck it; it sets our imagina-see-on to work. Also
it’s a special swanky tune for marching to; makes you
forget your poor feet. Like the tune, eh? Savvy?
Tipperary—you ’preciate the air—<i>le music, tray
bong, nace-pah?</i>”</p>

<p>J. P. (Beaming) “<i>La musique—la mélodie—ah, oui,
mais c’est</i>—how do you say him?” (triumphantly):
“<i>Luv-lee!</i>”</p>

<p>T. A.—(Enthusiastically) “Oh, good! <i>Bong garsong!</i>
You cottoned on beautifully that time, anyhow.”</p>

<p>J. P.—“<i>Comment?</i>”</p>

<p>T. A.-“Come on? Where? Oh, I see—one of
<i>your</i> words. Well?”</p>

<p>J. P.—“But, tell me, eet is how long—how far—to
Teeperary?”</p>

<p>T. A.—(Desperately) “Now look here, old dear;
I’ve had enough of this. You take it from me there’s
some things you bally well <i>can’t</i> get the hang of, and
this is one of ’em. Never mind; <i>donny-moi</i> one of
those funny little black fags of yours and we’ll toddle
to a <i>caffy</i> and drink to William the Conqueror—I
<i>don’t</i> think. Come on!”</p>

<p>J. P.—“<i>Comment?</i>”</p>

<p>T. A.—“That’s what I said.” (Takes his arm and
sings): “‘It’s a long—’”</p>

<p>J. P. (Joining in with huge glee as they go off)
“‘—long way to Teeperary, eet’s a long, long way
to go-o-o—’” (<i>Exeunt.</i>)</p>

<h3>PLENTY TO CHOOSE FROM</h3>

<p>Will Irwin, the war correspondent, supped in London
recently with Lincoln Springfield, editor.</p>

<p>“Lord Kitchener,” said Mr. Irwin, “told a young
lady some years since that, if he ever married, his
choice would be a German widow.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s making plenty of them now,” chuckled
Mr. Springfield.</p>


<h3>WINNING A BET</h3>

<p>One of the best stories told about Sir John French
is how, one night at dinner, some officers were discussing
rifle-shooting. The general was listening, as
was his wont, without making any remark, until at
length he chipped in with:</p>

<p>“Say, I’ll bet anyone here,” in his calm, quiet, deliberate
way, “that I can fire ten shots at 500 yards
and call each shot correctly without waiting for the
marker. I’ll stake a box of cigars on it.”</p>

<p>The major present accepted the offer, and the next
morning the whole mess was at the shooting range
to see the trial.</p>

<p>Sir John fired. “Miss!” he announced. He fired
again. “Miss!” he repeated. A third shot. “Miss!”</p>

<p>“Hold on there!” protested the major. “What are
you doing? You are not shooting at the target at
all.”</p>

<p>But French finished his task. “Miss!” “Miss!”
“Miss!”</p>

<p>“Of course I wasn’t shooting at the target,” he
said. “I was shooting for those cigars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>


<h3>COCKNEY GERMAN</h3>

<p>He was a shining light of the Intelligence Corps,
and before he arrived at Swakopmund his abilities as
a linguist were spoken of with bated breath. To him
there came his captain.</p>

<p>“Glad you’ve come, Jones,” said he; “we need a
man who speaks German. Take a file and go down
and tell that officer we made a prisoner yesterday that
I’ll give him parole, but if he attempts to escape he’ll
be shot.”</p>

<p>Off marched Jones, full of the importance of his
task.</p>

<p>“<i>Sprechen sie Deutsch?</i>” he asked the chap, to the
great admiration of the onlookers.</p>

<p>“<i>Ja, ja</i>,” said the big German, eagerly, glad to find
some one who understood him at last.</p>

<p>“Oh! yer do—do yer?” said Jones. “Well, old
sauerkraut, the captain says as ’ow ’e’ll give yer
parole, but if you blooming well tries to skip it, there’s
a bullet for yer! See?”</p>


<h3>IT PAYS TO ADVERTISE</h3>

<p>When the opposing lines of trenches are near
enough together, bombs of all kinds are being used
by both belligerents. Some of these bombs are made
out of old jam tins; and it is related how, when one
Pure Plum and Apple, bearing the maker’s name, had
succeeded in reaching its destination, the following
plaintive remark was heard from the German trenches:</p>

<p>“Ach, Himmel! These English, these shopkeepers,
how dey vos advertise!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<h3>ENGLISH MILITARY SLANG<br />

Tommy and His War Talk</h3>

<p>The fondness of soldier-boys for nicknames and
slang is proverbial. Their talk in barrack-room and
camp would at times puzzle the most versatile of linguists,
for “Tommy” prides himself on the originality
of his expressions. He has already developed a
slang of his own in connection with the German war,
and the official despatches mention that he has dubbed
the huge German shells “coal-boxes,” “Black Marias,”
“Jack Johnsons,” and “suit-cases.” Trenches exposed
to artillery fire are “stalls for the pictures,” while
when an artilleryman makes a good shot he chuckles
over the fact that he has “handed the Germans a good
plum.”</p>

<p>Wire entanglements are known as the “Zoo,” while
German spies are “playing offside.” “Flag-waggers”
and “helio-wobblers” for signalmen are fairly obvious
nicknames, and the latter’s grin when they hear them
is only equaled by that of the members of the Medical
Corps, who are known by the somewhat undignified
names of “poultice-wallopers” or “linseed lancers.”</p>

<p>The Ordnance Store Corps has been nicknamed the
“Sugar-Stick Brigade,” on account of the trimmings
on its uniform. Tall men in the army are generally
referred to as “lofties,” and more often than not a
cavalryman calls his horse his “long-faced chum,”
buglers being “fiddlers” or “wind-jammers.”</p>

<p>In ordinary conversation “Tommy” speaks of his
clothes as his “clobber,” and the canteen as the “tank,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a man who talks too much being known as a “chin-wagger.”
To be in hospital is to be “in dock,” while
money is referred to as “oof,” “rhino,” “the ready,”
“pewter,” or “shiners.” A sovereign is a “canary,”
and if a man wants to borrow money he is “trying to
raise a station” or “to get his feet under” (meaning
the canteen-table).</p>

<p>The man who drinks a lot is known as a “mopper,”
and “bun-stranglers” are temperance soldiers.</p>

<p>A Reservist is a “dug-out,” a recruit a “rookie,”
and a veteran an “old sweat.” A wheelwright in the
artillery is a “spoky,” while the long-service medal
is called the “rooti” medal—“rooti” being the slang
term for bread, because the owner has eaten most.
Puttees are known as “war socks,” and jam as
“possie.”</p>


<h3>INFORMATION WANTED</h3>

<p>The way they do things in some of the odd corners
of the British Empire, where they are comparatively
free from wireless telegrams, is very pretty. The officer
in charge of a certain hinterland received from
his superior officer at the base some time in August
this message:</p>

<p>“War has been declared. Arrest all enemy aliens
in your district.”</p>

<p>With commendable promptitude the superior officer
received this reply:</p>

<p>“Have arrested seven Germans, four Russians, two
Frenchmen, five Italians, two Roumanians, and an
American. Please say who we’re at war with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE AMUSING MONOCLE</h3>

<p>“Say, pop,” said the American tourist’s little boy
in London, “why does that there soldier wear an eyeglass
only on one eye?”</p>

<p>“So he kin use t’other one to see with!” Mr. Scrapple
answered.</p>


<h3>SURROUNDED!</h3>

<p>A weaver, who is noted for his joking propensities,
took his fellow-workers quite unawares the other morning.
He was reading, as has been his custom since
the war began, the latest news of Army and Fleet.
After glancing through the first page they were
astonished to see Jock looking wildly about him, and
gesticulating to his partner.</p>

<p>“What dost think? What dost think? British
Fleet ’as gotten surrounded. Dost yer? Dost yer?
Our Fleet ’as gotten surrounded!”</p>

<p>In less than five minutes they were off scanning
their papers for the unbelievable news. At last one
of the weavers, not being able to find the news in
his paper, approached Jock.</p>

<p>“Aw say, Jock, lad, wheer is it?”</p>

<p>“Wheer’s what? Th’ British Fleet? Whey, in t’
North Sea, aw reckon.”</p>

<p>“Aw mean wheer did ta see it about t’ German
Fleet having surrounded our Fleet?”</p>

<p>“Aw never said owt about th’ German Fleet; aw
said our Fleet ud gotten surrounded.”</p>

<p>“Well, what else con it be surrounded wi’, then?”</p>

<p>“Whey, it’s surrounded wi’ waythur, tha foo’!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<h3>TEXT FOR A BIG “STORY”</h3>

<p>An English correspondent said in Washington:</p>

<p>“I once tried to interview Lord Kitchener, the English
war minister. I tackled him after dinner in a
hotel lounge as he sipped his coffee and puffed on a
huge cigar. He stared at me when I proffered my
request, then he blew a cloud of smoke and said:</p>

<p>“‘I never gave an interview in my life, and I never
intend to.’</p>

<p>“This seemed decisive enough. I felt myself getting
red, and I stammered, as I prepared to go:</p>

<p>“‘Well, then, Lord Kitchener, will you at least give
me your autograph? It would be worth having.’</p>

<p>“He blew another cloud of smoke. Then he answered:</p>

<p>“‘You’d better go off and make your own autograph
worth having.’”</p>


<h3>NOT AS IT SEEMED</h3>

<p>Whilst making his usual daily inspection of the
stables the colonel noticed Private Jones giving his
horse a piece of lump sugar.</p>

<p>“I am very pleased to see you making much of
your horse, Private Jones,” he said; “it shows that
you regard him with the true spirit, and I will not forget
you for it.”</p>

<p>Private Jones waited until his commanding officer
was out of earshot, and then turned to his neighbor.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t making much of him,” he said. “The
blighter threw me off this morning, and I’m trying to
give him the blinkin’ toothache.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<h3>THERE WERE HOPES</h3>

<p>Mollie (aged seven), English, and proud of it, was
presented with a new and beautiful doll one morning.</p>

<p>A little later in the day she discovered the horrid
fact that it was “made in Germany.”</p>

<p>For a few tense moments the pride of her new possession
had a mental wrestle with patriotism. Then
Mollie remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, never mind, she’s very young, and I’ll bring
her up English.”</p>


<h3>FAMILIAR SOUNDS</h3>

<p>He had been a riveter in one of the large shipyards,
and was used to the din and roar of the thousands of
hammers used in connection therewith, which causes
deafness to many of the men engaged in this occupation.</p>

<p>When the call of King and Country sounded he
nobly responded and enlisted, and was eventually
drafted to the front.</p>

<p>It happened that the first of his nights near the
scene of action was supremely quiet, but just before
daylight the enemy’s guns came into action, and the
boom and roar of the “Jack Johnsons,” etc., woke
him with a start, and he gazed round the unusual
surroundings of his billet.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, mate?” asked one of the old hands,
seeing the expression on his face; “did you think
the world was comin’ to an end?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply, “but I thought I had slept
in, and they had started work without me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h3>IMPORTANT MESSAGES</h3>

<p>Recruiting is responsible for a good story from
Carmarthenshire. One of the latest accessions to
Kitchener’s army is a stalwart man 6 feet 2 inches in
height, from the heart of the country, and on joining
he expanded his chest with pride and ejaculated, “Now
for the Germans.”</p>

<p>The following day he received from London a telegram:
“Heartiest congratulations.—Kitchener.”</p>

<p>This was duly shown around, but next morning his
pride was boundless on receiving the Royal message:
“The Empire is proud of you.—George.”</p>

<p>It was not until the third day, when he received a
wire, “For Heaven’s sake, keep neutral.—Wilhelm,”
that he realized a waggish friend had been pulling his
leg.</p>


<h3>THE JEW AND THE CROSS</h3>

<p>“I am told,” said the Kaiser, “that you are a very
poor man, and the only support of your aged parents.
Because of your poverty you shall have your
choice between taking the Iron Cross or a hundred
marks.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” inquired the hero, “what is the
Cross worth in money?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” said the Emperor. “It is the honor
that makes it valuable. It is worth perhaps two
marks.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Einstein, drawing himself
up to his full height and saluting. “I will take the
Iron Cross and ninety-eight marks in cash!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h3>RETREAT IN ORDER</h3>

<p>Even an extremely aggressive enemy can be conquered
by strategy; it is only a question of employing
the stratagem fitted to the case.</p>

<p>An open-air preacher of East London understood
this, and his stratagem fitted to a charm. He was
addressing a crowd when a soldier who had been drinking
came up and ridiculed the service. Finding it
was useless to ignore the man, the preacher said:</p>

<p>“Ah, my friend, you’re no soldier. No servant of
the King would get drunk and interrupt a peaceful
service.”</p>

<p>The man said he was a soldier, and asked the
preacher to test him.</p>

<p>“Very well,” was the reply, “I will. Now, then,
attention!”</p>

<p>This the soldier did as well as his condition would
allow.</p>

<p>“About—turn!”</p>

<p>This order was also obeyed, though with some
trouble.</p>

<p>“Quick march!”</p>

<p>And off went the valiant soldier, marching down
the road at a quick pace, while the preacher resumed
his address.</p>


<h3>SUFFICIENTLY EQUIPPED</h3>

<p>Recruiting Sergeant—“I can’t enlist you, my good
man; you have only one eye.”</p>

<p>Patriotic Scotsman—“Hoots! that disna matter.
Ye’ve tae shut ae e’e whin yer shootin’ onywey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<h3>“NEXT OF KIN”</h3>

<p>A good recruiting story, told by an officer at Seaforth,
shows how prone is a simple mind to be confused
by the elaborate cross-questioning which the
new recruit has to undergo. The officer was entrusted
with the collection of particulars necessary for the
allotment of allowances to the soldiers’ dependents.</p>

<p>He was interrogating a young fellow who did not
seem to have a clear idea what it was all about.</p>

<p>“Next of kin?” he asked, in a sharp, business-like
way.</p>

<p>The young soldier dropped his voice and became
confidentially apologetic.</p>

<p>“I’m only wearing a jersey,” he replied; “my
shirt’s getting washed.”</p>


<h3>HIS BROTHER’S TASK</h3>

<p>A young lad applied for work the other day at a
shed in Burnley, where his three brothers had worked
previously, but had ’listed.</p>

<p>The manager, a thorough patriot, told the lad he
could find him two looms at once, and then asked him:</p>

<p>“How’s your brother Frank going on?”</p>

<p>“’E’s out at the front, sir, feighting.”</p>

<p>“Is your brother Albert out in France as well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, ’e’s wi’ eawr Frank—same regiment.”</p>

<p>“Your eldest brother, Jack, will be out there also,
I reckon?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the youngster, with a proud shake of
the head; “eawr Jack hesn’t gone to France yet. ’E’s
mindin’ India!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE SERGEANTS’ MESS</h3>

<p>“Do you mean that you want me to press your
trousers?” she demanded, with all the sternness she
could muster.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, my dear,” replied Sergeant
Euchre, affably. “Am I asking too much?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should just about think so, Charles William.
I’d have you know that when you married me
you didn’t marry a flat-iron.”</p>

<p>Charles William thought a lot. That same evening
Mrs. Euchre chipped in with, “Oh, Charles, you
might just button my dress up the back before you
go out.”</p>

<p>But Sergeant Euchre merely filled his pipe as he
chuckled softly, “Not much, popsy-wopsy. You must
remember that when you accepted me you did not
marry a buttonhook.”</p>

<p>And setting his cap at a rakish angle, he made for
the sergeants’ mess.</p>


<h3>BOUND TO KEEP OUT OF IT</h3>

<p>A recruiting sergeant, holding forth on the absolute
necessity of every man enlisting, encountered an
Irish wit.</p>

<p>“Halloa, John! Why can’t you join the Colors? I
don’t know how any man can stand aside in such terrible
circumstances. Why, what would you do if the
enemy came over here, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said John, “that’s the simplest thing on
earth. Why, shure, I’d enlist for foreign service
then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<h3>CLEVER MACKAY</h3>

<p>Private John Mackay was pondering over the common
problem of “raising the wind.” He was absolutely
stony, hadn’t even the money to buy himself
a packet of “fags.” But as he pondered an idea of
striking originality took shape, which so delighted
him with its simplicity that he immediately put it into
practice.</p>

<p>Entering a hut, which, along with hundreds of
others, Kitchener has caused to be built to protect
the soldiers from the changes of weather, he called
to attention the party of new recruits.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he began, as he produced a highly-polished
silver watch, “I have here a watch to sell.
I already have a wristlet watch”—here he used the
conventional lie—“so there is no use keeping this one.
Now, what do you offer for it?” The question was
addressed to no one in particular.</p>

<p>Save for cries of “a halfpenny” and “threepence,”
no one appeared to be interested. But Mac wasn’t
downhearted. Advancing farther into the hut, he
held up his hand.</p>

<p>“We’ll raffle it, then,” he suggested, still feigning
that he believed he would get a purchaser. “Here
is a pack of cards.”</p>

<p>The cards were handed over, shuffled, and with the
actions of an expert card player, a recruit deposited
a card in front of each of the assembled men.</p>

<p>“Now, each man back his card, threepence all round,
and the watch goes to the highest card.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>This was done with remarkable speed, the recruits
had pocket-money in plenty, and the schemer now
gathered in his shekels. The cards were then turned,
and the fellow who had managed to win rushed off
to his corner, exultantly bearing his prize. Mac departed.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mac quietly slipped into the
recruits’ hut, and going over to the man who had
captured the watch, whispered:</p>

<p>“The man I got the watch from is wanting it. I’ll
very likely get into a scrape if I don’t get it. I’ll
give you a shilling for it.”</p>

<p>The recruit quickly jumped to the conclusion that
Mac had stolen the watch, and not wishing to be connected
in any way with stolen property, promptly
handed it back.</p>

<p>As Mac went off with his watch to his own hut he
muttered: “That’s raised the wind, anyway.”</p>


<h3>EXCUSE FOR POOR SHOOTING</h3>

<p>The other day some Scottish Territorials were at
the rifle butts. One of the men, a tailor by trade, was
making exceedingly bad practice, and missing the target
every shot. At length the officer in command became
angry, and inquired gruffly:</p>

<p>“Can you not see the target, sir? Surely you, as
a tailor, must thread your own needle!”</p>

<p>“Oh, aye, I can see the target,” replied the Terrier,
calmly, “an’ I can thread a needle as well; but
wha the mischief ever tried to thread a needle at twa
hunder yairds?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<h3>CORRECT; GO TO THE HEAD</h3>

<p>The schoolmaster wanted to know whether the boys
had an understanding of the functions of a British
Consulate.</p>

<p>“Supposing,” he began, framing his question in
the likeliest way to arouse the interest of his hearers,
“supposing some one took you up in an aeroplane,
and after a long, exciting flight, dropped you down
thousands of miles from home in a country quite
foreign, what place would you seek out first of all?”</p>

<p>An eager hand was instantly uplifted.</p>

<p>“Well, Willie, what do you say?”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, the hospital.”</p>


<h3>SELF-INTEREST PARAMOUNT</h3>

<p>A senator was talking about the war. “Each side,”
he said, “is declaring hotly now that it will never receive
the foe within its hospitable borders again, and
that after the war there will be no trading with the
enemy forevermore.</p>

<p>“When we hear talk like that, let us smile skeptically,
remembering the vain campaign of Wilberforce.</p>

<p>“When Wilberforce was fighting against slavery in
London a shopkeeper put up a sign: ‘No goods
made with slave-grown cotton sold here.’ But the
man’s rival then put up another sign: ‘All our goods
are made from cheap, slave-grown cotton.’</p>

<p>“This latter sign got all the trade, of course. If
the first one hadn’t been taken down at once it would
have driven its author into bankruptcy.”</p>

<h3>WHY THEY WOULDN’T SHOOT</h3>

<p>A correspondent sends to the “Manchester Guardian”
this story, evidently from an ironical Swiss paper.
A few soldiers belonging to the brass band of a regiment
in garrison at Basle went to a certain café for
refreshments. One of them sat down alone at a table.
Later a civilian, a German, joined him, and the two
began to talk war politics.</p>

<p>“Would you shoot the Germans if they invaded
Switzerland?” asked the German.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, never!” exclaimed the soldier.</p>

<p>“Waiter, a pint of beer and a beefsteak with potatoes
for this brave man,” ordered the civilian. “And
your pals sitting at the next table—would they also
not shoot the Germans if they tried to invade this
country?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, never!” retorted the Swiss.</p>

<p>“Waiter, a glass of beer for each of the soldiers
at the next table!” ordered the civilian. And, addressing
again the soldier, he asked: “Is this generally
the view held in the Swiss army in regard to
a possible German invasion? Are all the Swiss soldiers
so Germanophil?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the soldier.</p>

<p>“But why would you not shoot the Germans?”</p>

<p>“Because we belong to the band!”</p>


<h3>SHOOK ALL OVER</h3>

<p>She—“Tell me, when you were in the army were
you cool in the hour of danger?”</p>

<p>He—“Cool? I actually shivered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE ONLY HINDRANCE</h3>

<p>Pat Molloy came in for his evening’s beverage, and
paper in hand, as usual. The crowd kept quiet to
hear the latest war news. Pat said the war had reached
a crisis, and that there was only one obstacle between
the Allied Forces and Berlin. His listeners were dumfounded,
and one of them, recovering quicker than
the others, asked:</p>

<p>“And what might that be, Pat?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Pat, emptying his glass; “it’s nothing
but the Germany army.”</p>


<h3>IRISH VS. GERMAN</h3>

<p>The Irish Tommy, prisoner, was feeling very wroth
with the destroyers of Louvain, when a German officer
dashed by on what Paddy termed “a rare bit of horseflesh.”</p>

<p>“Faith, that’s an Irish horse,” said Paddy, and his
eyes glinted maliciously at the Teutonic soldier, who
had a fair knowledge of English, and at once took up
the glove. They would probably have come to blows,
in spite of Paddy’s precarious position, had not a
compatriot of his proposed that whoever could tell
the biggest lie might claim the horse for his country.
Paddy forthwith began a tale which was one lie from
beginning to end, and stopped triumphantly. Then
his Teutonic opponent began, in slow, but correct,
English:——</p>

<p>“There was once a German gentleman——”</p>

<p>“That settles it,” said Paddy, with a sigh of resignation;
“the horse is a German one!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>


<h3>WISE PRECAUTION</h3>

<p>Rain was falling steadily as the weary cyclist plodded
on through the mud. At last he spied a figure
walking towards him through the gloom. Gladly he
sprang off his machine, and asked the native:—</p>

<p>“How far off is the village of Poppleton?”</p>

<p>“Just ten miles the other way, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“The other way!” exclaimed the cyclist. “But the
last signpost I passed said it was in this direction.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the native, with a knowing grin, “but,
ye see, we warped that there post round so as to fool
those ’ere Zeppelins.”</p>


<h3>A BLOODLESS BATTLE</h3>

<p>The occasion was the regimental ball. The band
was there, and the palms and the refreshment buffet
and everything was lovely.</p>

<p>But in one corner, behind a beautiful green rampart
of palms, the young lieutenant and the colonel’s
daughter were trying to occupy the same chair, and
were giving other evidence of the fact that their hearts
had been pierced by some of Cupid’s darts.</p>

<p>Suddenly an intruder appeared—a fierce intruder
in the uniformed personage of the young lady’s
father. Instantly the chair was abandoned, and the
youthful swain stood at attention.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he said, in sharp, staccato tones, “I have the
honor to report an engagement, in which I have been
entirely victorious. Now, sir, it merely remains for
you to give your official sanction of the terms of surrender.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>


<h3>AT A PARIS HOTEL</h3>

<p>“My plate is damp.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” whispered his wife. “That’s your soup.
They serve small portions in war time.”</p>


<h3>THE LAST RESORT</h3>

<p>Frau von Schmidt (of Berlin)—“Otto, where are
we going for holidays this summer?”</p>

<p>Otto—“Well—er—there’s Turkey.”</p>


<h3>CRUEL SPITE</h3>

<p>Village Haberdasher—“Yew take it from me, sir,
folk in our village be very spiteful agin the Germans.
Why, Oi reckon Oi’ve sold fifty ’ankerchers wi’ Kitchener’s
face on ’em!”</p>


<h3>AN UNLOVED OFFICIAL</h3>

<p>Actual extract from a sailor’s letter to his wife:</p>

<p>“Dear Jane,—I am sending you a postal order for
10s, which I hope you may get—but you may not—as
this letter has to pass the Censor.”</p>


<h3>EXTREMITY; MEANING FEET?</h3>

<p>He—“I hear that you are knitting socks for the
fighting soldiers.”</p>

<p>She—“Yes; man’s extremity is woman’s opportunity,
you know.”</p>


<h3>AS EVER</h3>

<p>“Since the war began women have been taking the
places of the men on the Paris street-cars.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’d do it here, but the men are too ill-mannered
to get up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>


<h3>AN OLD JOKE WORKED OVER</h3>

<p>A school teacher recently gave his pupils a lecture
on patriotism. He pointed out the high motives
which moved the Territorials to leave their homes and
fight for their country.</p>

<p>The school teacher noticed that one boy did not
pay attention to the instruction, and as a test question
he asked him:</p>

<p>“What motives took the Territorials to the war?”</p>

<p>The boy was puzzled for a moment, then, remembering
the public “send-off” to the local regiment at
the railway station, he replied:</p>

<p>“Locomotives, sir.”</p>


<h3>REASONABLE PREJUDICE</h3>

<p>Softly the nurse smoothed the sufferer’s pillow. He
had only been admitted that morning, and now he
looked pleadingly up at the “ministering angel” who
stood at his bedside.</p>

<p>“An’ phwat did yez say the docthor’s name was,
nurse, dear?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Dr. Kilpatrick,” was the reply. “He’s the senior
house surgeon.”</p>

<p>The sufferer winced, and pulled a wry face.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” he muttered, firmly. “That docthor
won’t get no chance to operate on me.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the nurse, in surprise. “He’s a
very clever man.”</p>

<p>“That’s as may be,” the patient said again, his
voice cold and strong. “But me name happens to
be Patrick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h3>WAR’S UNKNOWN HEROES</h3>

<p>Some men, dressed in civilian clothes, gathered together
in the smoking-room of the hotel, discussing
the joys and sorrows of life at the Front.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been with the Army and had a very
interesting time,” said one.</p>

<p>“Ever got really alone with the enemy?” asked
another.</p>

<p>“Rather! I once took two of their officers.”</p>

<p>“Unaided?”</p>

<p>“Of course! And the very next day I took eight
men!”</p>

<p>“All wounded, I expect,” sneered a listener. “You
didn’t get hurt, did you?”</p>

<p>“Just a slight scratch, that’s all. And two days
after I took a transport wagon, and followed up that
by taking a big gun.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said a disagreeable auditor, “I have seen
some of the finest specimens of anything you can call
to mind, but I wish to state that you are the biggest
romancer that ever trod this earth.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, I am not that,” replied the hero; “but I
am a photographer!”</p>


<h3>THE RETORT JUVENILE</h3>

<p>A well-informed miss of fourteen inquired of her
brother, “What would you say if you met a German
lady and she said, ‘Good morning, God punish England’?”</p>

<p>The boy quickly replied, “I’d say, ‘Don’t you
think you’re very Hun-ladylike?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>


<h3>JUST TWO SHOTS APIECE</h3>

<p>They are telling a story in Switzerland about what
would happen if the Kaiser violated Swiss, as he has
already violated Belgian, neutrality.</p>

<p>The Kaiser was amazed at a Swiss drill by the shooting
of the Switzers, who all scored bull’s-eyes.</p>

<p>“Wonderful shots!” said the Kaiser to a Swiss general.
“Wonderful shots!”</p>

<p>“And we have, your Majesty, 100,000 such shots
in the Swiss army,” the general answered.</p>

<p>The Kaiser laughed, and in a joking way he said:</p>

<p>“But suppose I invaded you with 200,000 soldiers?”</p>

<p>“In that case, your Majesty,” said the other, “we
should each of us fire twice.”</p>


<h3>MISSED THE USUAL SIGNAL</h3>

<p>A certain regiment stationed in Belfast was mustered
in the Ormean Park for inspection, and were
standing awaiting the arrival of their colonel. Presently
the commanding officer was seen approaching
on horseback, but when a few paces from the troops
the horse (which had been hired for the day) stood
stock-still, and refused to move.</p>

<p>The officer made desperate efforts to urge on his
steed, but all to no purpose. Before long a group of
bystanders encircled him, and one of them, a ragged
urchin, suddenly cried out to his chum:—</p>

<p>“I say, Bill, run and ring the park bell; it’s a
tramcar horse.”</p>

<p>This was enough for the colonel, who at once dismounted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<h3>RIVERS IN THE WAR, NOW FAMOUS IN
THE WORLD’S HISTORY</h3>

<p>Rivers have always played a great and sometimes a
decisive rôle in the great drama of war, and the colossal
European struggle raging at the present moment
is no exception to the rule. On the contrary, the
greatest battle the world has ever seen, both by reason
of its duration and the numbers engaged, is not
unlikely to go down to history as the Battle of the
Rivers. These are the Aisne, the Oise, and the Somme,
all of which, during that interminable battle, literally
ran with blood.</p>

<p>What a rôle, too, has the Meuse played in this
war! Indeed, it may be safely said that this river literally
saved the situation, for it was the difficulty of
crossing it in the face of the fire of the Liége forts
which caused that fortnight’s delay in the carrying
out of the Kaiser’s programme which saved France,
and perhaps eventually the British Empire. During
that fortnight the waters of the Meuse were choked
with the bodies of the slain.</p>

<p>The River Marne will ever be memorable because
it was along the line of that river that the great
battle—a battle which may later be regarded as one
of the decisive battles of the war—took place, which
turned the Germans back upon their long journey
home. Tens of thousands on both sides were slain in
attempts to cross and recross this stream.</p>

<p>The River Nethe, a tributary of the Scheldt,
formed one of the main obstacles to the Germans in
their great assault upon Antwerp. Time and time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
again the Germans succeeded in getting a pontoon
bridge completed and came down to the river bank
in solid masses to cross it. As they came every Belgian
gun that could be turned upon the spot was
concentrated upon them and they were blown away
and the bridge destroyed, until the river literally ran
with blood. Similar destructions of pontoon bridges
burdened with their living freight of men and horses
and guns have occurred on all the many rivers which
this war has brought into the terrible limelight of
battle.</p>


<h3>A BITING RETORT</h3>

<p>“Jones, the captain wants you, matey. Whatcher
bin doin’?”</p>

<p>“It’s that dog!” ejaculated Private Jones, as he
made ready to appear before his superior officer.</p>

<p>“Jones,” said that worthy, frowningly, “this gentleman
complain that you have killed his dog.”</p>

<p>“A dastardly trick,” warmly interrupted the owner
of the dog, “to kill a defenseless animal that would
harm no one!”</p>

<p>“Not much defenseless about it,” chimed in the private,
heatedly. “He bit pretty freely into my leg
while I was on sentry duty, so I ran my bayonet into
him.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” answered the owner, angrily. “He
was such a docile creature. Why did you not defend
yourself with the butt of your rifle?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he bite me with his tail?” asked Private
Jones, humbly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<h3>WE SUGGEST THIS TO ALL OF ’EM</h3>

<p>A visitor to a West-end restaurant in London, being
waited on by a particularly tall and fine-looking
waiter with a foreign accent, asked the man his nationality.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am a Hungarian,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“How comes it, then, that a big, strong fellow like
you is not in the firing line?” asked the visitor.</p>

<p>“Vell, sir, it’s like this,” replied the knight of the
napkin, pointing to a brother waiter a few tables off;
“you see that man? Vell, he’s a Serb, and we have
vat you call paired.”</p>


<h3>CAUSE FOR HOME-SICKNESS</h3>

<p>The recruit walked into the barrack-room and inadvertently
left the door open. An old soldier immediately
yelled:—</p>

<p>“Shut the door, you fool! Where were you born—in
a barn?”</p>

<p>The youngster closed the door, then, dropping
down on his cot, buried his face in his hands and
began to weep. The old soldier looked somewhat uncomfortable,
and, rising, finally walked over to the
weeper and tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Look here, boy,” he said, “I didn’t intend to hurt
your feelings. I just wanted the door closed.”</p>

<p>The weeper raised his head and grinned.</p>

<p>“Comrade,” he said, “I’m not crying because you
hurt my feelings; but because you asked me if I was
born in a barn. I was, and every time I hear an ass
bray it makes me feel home-sick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>


<h3>REGULAR SEA DOG</h3>

<p>A sailor belonging to one of His Majesty’s ships
returned home unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s up, Jack?” asked his old father,
when he saw him.</p>

<p>“Had to put back. Too rough,” said the Tar, jocularly.</p>

<p>“Too rough! Well, that’s yere modern navy, is it,
with her quick-firers and torpedo-catchers? Too
rough, eh? Why, Jack, my boy, I remembers when
I was in the old Grampius—well, it was a gale, and it
did blow. Well, it blowed so hard that the skipper
gave orders to cut away the mast, and no sooner had
the carpenter appeared on deck than the wind blowed
the teeth clean out of his saw!”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” retorted Jack. “Only yesterday
the wind happened to veer round and caught our
guns end on and it blowed the breeches clean out of
all of them.”</p>

<p>“Jack, my boy,” said the old man, “give me yer
hand. Yer was cut out for the sea.”</p>


<h3>PROFESSIONAL TREATMENT</h3>

<p>Patient (to pretty nurse)—“Will you be my wife
when I recover?”</p>

<p>Pretty Nurse—“Certainly.”</p>

<p>Patient—“Then you love me?”</p>

<p>Pretty Nurse—“Oh, no! That’s merely a part of
my treatment. I must keep my patients cheerful. I
promised this morning to run away with a married
man who had lost both his legs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<h3>WAR NEWS IN THE PANTRY</h3>

<p>“James!” she said, severely.</p>

<p>The butler looked up with a guilty flush.</p>

<p>“James,” she asked, “how is it that whenever I
come into the pantry I find your work at sixes and
sevens, and you sprawled out reading the war news?”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am,” the butler answered, “I should say
it was on account of them old rubber-sole shoes you’re
always wearin’ about the house.”</p>


<h3>DRAWING THE LINE</h3>

<p>There was on Master Tommy Whiffles’s face, as
he came in from play, an expression of unalloyed
satisfaction. He bounced down on the one sound
spring of the sofa with a sigh so indicative of profound
content that his father was instantly filled with
misgivings.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards Dabbs, from the next
street, strode up the garden path and gave a pull at
the front-door bell.</p>

<p>“If I catch your boy playing war games within a
mile of my place again,” he announced, “I’ll trounce
him till his hide looks like the paint on a barber’s
pole.”</p>

<p>“Steady, old fellow, steady,” advised Whiffles,
senior. “It’s very stupid for you to throw out rash
threats. What boy wouldn’t play war games nowadays,
eh? Boys will be boys, you know.”</p>

<p>“Let him keep a boy, then,” snarled Dabbs; “it’s
when he imagines himself a Prussian army corps and
my greenhouse a cathedral that I draw the line.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>


<h3>NO UNION HOURS</h3>

<p>The soldier was telling the workman about a battle
that he had once been in that had lasted from eight
o’clock in the morning until seven o’clock at night.
His description was most graphic, and he became very
enthusiastic as he lived through the stirring scenes
again.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I can’t understand about the
story,” said the workman, slowly, when he had finished.
“You say that the battle began at eight o’clock
in the morning and lasted until seven o’clock at night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Then,” retorted the workman, with a puzzled air,
“what I can’t make out is, how did you manage about
your dinner-hour?”</p>


<h3>MISSED SOMETHING</h3>

<p>Green was a raw recruit, and in his ignorance of
the ways of the army had committed some slight offense.
When brought before the colonel, that worthy
was pleased to let him off with only a sharp admonition.
The facts of the case appeared in the regimental
orders, and when Green read the account he
rushed off to his sergeant breathless with indignation.</p>

<p>“Why, sergeant, it says in the orders that I was
‘discharged with an admonition,’” he complained.
“An’ all I got was a good wiggin’. Some other fellow
’as been and kept that admonition and means to
do me out of it. Now, I wants to know what it is,
for I mean to have it. I don’t mean to be cheated
out of anything!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>


<h3>HIS MEANING IS PLAIN</h3>

<p>The wounded Irish soldier was relating his adventures
to the inquisitive old lady visitor.</p>

<p>“Afther we captured th’ hill, mum,” he said, “we
hild it fur a whoile, but was evintually forced to retrate
by th’ weight av numbers.”</p>

<p>“And were there many dead left on the hill?” she
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Dead!” he echoed. “Whoi, the whole hillsoide
was simply aloive wid thim!”</p>


<h3>SOONER OR LATER</h3>

<p>Private —— was known to all his chums as “the
early bird,” probably because it was an exact description
of the very opposite to what he really was, for
“the early bird” was always late, the last man to get
out of bed at reveille and the last man on parade, and
when his regiment sailed for France his chums declared
that he was the last into the transport ship and the
last out of it.</p>

<p>When his regiment was doing its spell in the
trenches “the early bird” was sent for by his officer,
and as he was creeping along the trench towards the
dug-out a stray bullet caught him in the shoulder,
just as he was outside the officer’s shelter.</p>

<p>After seeing that he wasn’t seriously wounded, the
officer exclaimed, with a twinkle in his eye, “If you
had just been a second earlier you would have missed
that.”</p>

<p>“I would, sir,” returned Private ——, “or if I had
been a second later it would have missed me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>


<h3>INTERRUPTED REPAST</h3>

<p>A Territorial on guard one night was walking up
and down his beat in a business-like way when one of
his chums brought him some pudding, which he was
very pleased to get.</p>

<p>He was sitting down in the sentry-box, eating it,
when the general of his regiment came up to him in
civilian clothes.</p>

<p>The Territorial carried on with his pudding, not
noticing the general.</p>

<p>The general said:—</p>

<p>“Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>“You’re the general’s servant?”</p>

<p>“No; guess again.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re his butler?”</p>

<p>“No; guess again.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you are the general himself?”</p>

<p>“That’s who I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, half a mo! Hold this pudding until I present
arms.”</p>


<h3>AN EXCELLENT BRIGADE</h3>

<p>We heard of a man the other day who, being apparently
of military age (though he was really over
it), was confronted by the usual old gentleman in the
usual railway carriage with the challenge why had
he not joined.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I belong to the M. B. B.,” said the victim.</p>

<p>“M. B. B.? What’s that, sir?”</p>

<p>“The Mind My Own Business Brigade,” replied
the other, resuming his reading of the paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<h3>WHY THEY THREW HIM IN AGAIN</h3>

<p>A dentist in an English east-coast town was one
day standing on the pier watching the evolutions of
some warships, when he accidentally toppled into the
water. Three recruits who were standing by immediately
plunged in to the rescue and hauled him out.</p>

<p>On recovering his breath, he looked admiringly at
his brave rescuers, and in a voice filled with deep
gratitude he said:</p>

<p>“My brave fellows, how can I ever repay you for
your gallantry? Just come along to my consulting
rooms, and I’ll draw all the bloomin’ teeth out of your
heads, and not charge you a penny.”</p>


<h3>NOTHING TO FUSS ABOUT</h3>

<p>At a “certain place in France” where the British
and German trenches are within shouting distance
of each other, the German soldiers were loudly singing
one of their favorite war songs, “Gott mit uns!
Gott mit uns!”</p>

<p>These “vain repetitions” palled on the Britons after
a time, and at last an exasperated Jock arose in wrath
and shouted across to the enemy, “Hae dune wi’ yer
bletherin’! Ilka yin o’ us has got mittens tae, tho’
we dinna mak’ sic a fash aboot them.”</p>


<h3>FOES AS FRIENDS</h3>

<p>Undoubtedly the most amazing feature of the present
war was the manner in which foe fraternized with
foe on Christmas Day—when English and German exchanged
presents, had Christmas trees in the trenches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and gave concerts for one another’s benefit. Nevertheless,
these incidents are no new feature of warfare.
Wellington had to cope with what he regarded as a
very serious similar state of affairs during the Peninsular
war. He issued the strictest orders and took
the severest measures to stop it, making it punishable
with death for any man to be found holding any form
of intercourse with the enemy.</p>

<p>When in Portugal the English lines were so close
to those of the army of Massena that the horses had
to water at the same river which separated them, the
soldiers came to a mutual understanding not to fire
on one another when drawing water. This led to an
exchange of gifts and finally to the amazing spectacle
of English and French soldiers sitting round the same
camp fires, sharing rations and playing cards.</p>

<p>It seems to be a common phenomenon of war that,
however bitter the struggle, a feeling of friendship
will spring up after a time between the troops in the
front ranks if they are close to one another for any
length of time. It was so in the Russo-Japanese war,
and it seems to arise from a growing respect for one’s
adversary in sharing common hardships and danger.
National feeling gives way before the fellow-feeling
for the man opposite, who, after all, is not responsible
for the war, but only obeying orders.</p>

<p>As one paper said at the time of the incident in
this present war, “The little tales of the Christmas
truce in the trenches prove that the gospel of brotherhood
is more powerful than the gospel of hate.”</p>

<h3>STRICTLY OBEDIENT</h3>

<p>Colonel Kemyss, of the 40th Regiment, was remarkable
for the studied pomposity of his diction.
One day, observing that a careless man in the ranks
had a particularly dirty face, which appeared not to
have been washed for a twelvemonth, he was exceedingly
indignant at so gross a violation of military
propriety.</p>

<p>“Take him,” said he to the corporal, who was an
Irishman, “take the man and lave him in the waters
of the Guadiana.”</p>

<p>After some time the corporal returned.</p>

<p>“What have you done with the man I sent with
you?” inquired the colonel. Up flew the corporal’s
right hand across the peak of his cap.</p>

<p>“Sure an’t plaise y’r honor, and didn’t y’r honor
tell me to lave him in the river? And sure enough I
left him in the river, and there he is now, according
to y’r honor’s orders.”</p>


<h3>NOT LIKELY</h3>

<p>A Barbados plantation negro is reported to have
said to his overseer:</p>

<p>“Massa, is it true that before the war the Kaiser
sent a bag of rice to King George and told him, ‘King
George, I’se got as many soldiers as there is rice in
this bag,’ and that King George sent to the Kaiser
a bottle of the hottest peppers that grows and tell
him, ‘I only got as many soldiers as peppers in this
bottle, but you just bite one of them and you’ll see
how your soldiers will like ’em’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE KAISER’S INCOME<br />

How His Money Is Invested</h3>

<p>Thanks to the advice of financiers who, for obvious
reasons, he admitted to his friendship, the Kaiser’s
private fortune has increased to such an extent of late
years that it was estimated a short time ago by the
eminent German authority, Herr Rudolph Martin,
that he is easily the richest man in Germany, having
an annual income of five million dollars derived from
possessions valued at approximately $100,000,000.</p>

<p>Apart from the Kaiser’s fortune, his son, the Crown
Prince, has a separate income of $250,000, drawn
from property valued at nearly $5,000,000, while the
Kaiser’s brother, Prince Henry, enjoys some $150,000
a year on account of an estate worth two and a
half million. Altogether the principal members of
the Hohenzollern family own property valued at approximately
$125,000,000.</p>

<p>The Kaiser’s fortune has been mainly built up by
investments in many businesses. He has some very
large holdings in the big German steamship lines, is
extensively interested in the diamond-mine enterprises
of German West Africa, owns forests and lands to
the value of seventeen and a half millions, carries on
a large lumber business, and has a horse-breeding establishment
in Western Prussia which brings him in
a handsome revenue. Furthermore, he has great financial
interests in a municipal lager-beer brewery at
Hanover, and founded an extensive pottery factory
on his private estates at Cadinen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Altogether the Kaiser owns about forty castles and
country houses, valued at $10,000,000, and various
property in Berlin, approximately worth $5,000,000.
In seven different provinces he owns seventy-four estates,
comprising close on half a million acres.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that ever since Germany
began to make preparations for a great war the
Kaiser has been investing immense sums of money on
the other side of the Atlantic. He is one of the
largest landowners in the Western United States—not
in his own name, of course—and owns a considerable
section of property in the West of Canada. So notorious
is the fact that it was at one time a standing
joke at Vancouver that, although the Kaiser was a
large owner of property in a certain district, he declined
to join the local ratepayers’ association, which
would have been materially assisted in its propaganda
by the use of his name.</p>


<h3>SOMETHING REPOSEFUL</h3>

<p>Soldiers were called for, owing to the scarcity of
civilians, to work the railway. The weary “Tommies”
were lying in camp one night after a hard day’s work,
when a sergeant called out:</p>

<p>“Any of you men want to put your names down
as railway porters, drivers, stokers, half-boiled clerks,
or for any other appointments connected with the
railway?”</p>

<p>Silence, broken only by snores. Then one “Tommy”
slowly raised his head and drowsily muttered:</p>

<p>“Put me down as a sleeper, sergeant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<h3>ENOUGH IS TOO MUCH</h3>

<p>“Are you going to the Wallerby reception tonight?”</p>

<p>“No. The Twobbles will be there, so I declined my
invitation.”</p>

<p>“Why do you object to the presence of the Twobbles?”</p>

<p>“I don’t object to their presence particularly, but
I have already heard them tell the story of their escape
from Berlin ten or twelve times, and I don’t feel
equal to another recital.”</p>


<h3>TELLING HIM ALL ABOUT IT</h3>

<p>The recruits were going through their first course
of musketry, and they were in charge of a full-blown
second lieutenant, who was trying to show his authority,
together with his great knowledge of musketry.
Sauntering up to the latest recruit, he said:—</p>

<p>“See here, my man, this thing is a rifle; this is the
barrel, this is the butt, and this is where you put the
cartridge in.”</p>

<p>The recruit seemed to be taking it all in, so the
officer, continuing, said:—</p>

<p>“You put the weapon to your shoulder; these little
things on the barrel are called sights; then to fire
you pull this little thing, which is called the trigger.
Now smarten yourself up, and remember what I have
told you, and, by the way, what trade did you follow
before you enlisted?—a collier, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” came the reply. “I only worked as a
gunsmith for the Government Small Arms Factory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE ENGLISH LIKE THIS KIND</h3>

<p>A little boy received a toy donkey as a birthday
present.</p>

<p>“What are you going to call it?” asked his father.</p>

<p>“King George,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said his father, “that would never do.
That would be an insult to the King. Why not call
it the Kaiser?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said the little boy, indignantly, “that
would be an insult to my donkey.”</p>


<h3>GAVE IT AWAY</h3>

<p>A Scottish Territorial was having his first experience
of night duty, and was feeling a little nervous.
The password was “Discount.”</p>

<p>In the darkest of the small hours a black form
suddenly stepped up to him.</p>

<p>“Wh-wh-who goes there?” he challenged.</p>

<p>“Friend,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Advance, f-f-friend, and give the d-d-discount.”</p>


<h3>A “SHIRT-SLEEVE GENERAL”</h3>

<p>It was in South Africa that General French earned
the title of the “shirt-sleeve General”—a sobriquet
that conveys a subtle compliment from “Tommy’s”
point of view. Actually French was often to be
seen walking about in camp during his heavy marches
in shirt-sleeves, writes Mr. Cecil Chisholm, in his biography
of Sir John French.</p>

<p>One afternoon a correspondent rode up to the lines,
and, seeing a soldier sitting on a bundle of hay, smoking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a dilapidated-looking old briar pipe, asked where
the General was.</p>

<p>“The old man is somewhere about,” coolly replied
the soldier.</p>

<p>“Well, just hold my horse while I go and search
for him.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” and the smoker rose and obediently
took the bridle.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me where the General is?” inquired
the correspondent of a staff-officer farther down the
line.</p>

<p>“General French? Oh, he’s somewhere about. Why,
there he is, holding that horse’s head!”</p>

<p>And the officer pointed directly to the smoker, still
tranquilly pulling at his pipe and holding the horse.
Needless to say, “Uncle French” and his men hugely
enjoyed the correspondent’s awakening.</p>


<h3>GRIN AND BEAR IT</h3>

<p>“This war will go on and on,” said Mrs. Harry
Payne Whitney, who has given a $250,000 field hospital
to the belligerents.</p>

<p>“This war will go on and on,” she repeated, sadly,
“and the side that is getting the worst of it will display
the spirit of little Willie.</p>

<p>“Little Willie’s father, as he laid on the slipper,
said:</p>

<p>“‘Willie, this hurts me more, far more, than it does
you.’</p>

<p>“‘Then keep it up,’ said Willie, grinding his teeth.
‘Keep it up, dad. I can stand it.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHANCE FOR A FREE RIDE</h3>

<p>General Servant—“If you please, mum, may I have
a ’oliday?”</p>

<p>Mistress—“Why, Jane, you have had a fortnight’s
holiday these last twelve months already.”</p>

<p>Servant—“Yes, mum; but the baker tells me that
the Government gents is sending generals out to
France, their fares is paid by the taxes, and I thought
the sea-trip would do me good, mum.”</p>


<h3>KING ALBERT—CHAUFFEUR</h3>

<p>The King of the Belgians, one of the most democratic
of European monarchs, was spending some time
in Switzerland in the summer when the following incident
happened.</p>

<p>At Territet the King and Queen were motoring.
His Majesty was driving, and there were no attendants.
The Queen went into a shop to make some
purchases. The King was standing by the car reading
a newspaper, when an American woman came out
of the shop, jumped into the car, which she mistook
for a public conveyance, and bade the monarch to
drive her quickly to her hotel.</p>

<p>“Certainly, madam,” said the King, and deposited
the woman at the hotel.</p>

<p>Accounts vary as to whether the King accepted or
did not accept any fare.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Queen had come out of the
store and was surprised to find that her husband and
the car were absent. However, they speedily returned,
and their Majesties laughed over the story together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<h3>TIRED AND CROSS</h3>

<p>Two companies of the “Buffs” were marching along
after a very tiring day, when a young staff officer
galloped up to the captain in command of the party.</p>

<p>“Are you the West Riding?” he asked.</p>

<p>But before the captain had time to reply a gruff
voice answered from the ranks, “No, we’re the Buffs—walking.”</p>


<h3>TURKISH NAVAL EFFICIENCY</h3>

<p>The acquisition of a brand-new Brazilian Dreadnaught
by Turkey recalls the story of the Turkish admiral
who had been newly appointed to the command
of the Ægean squadron. He installed himself in the
admiral’s quarters—which opened to the sternwalk—on
board the new flagship one evening, and went to
bed. Next morning he awoke and ordered full speed
ahead. After a little delay the propeller began to revolve,
but as it had not moved since the ship was sold
to Turkey—at more than cost price by a power which
had no use for it—it made a tremendous racket.</p>

<p>“Allah!” cried the admiral. “What in the name of
the Prophet is this uproar?”</p>

<p>“That, Excellency, is the propeller,” replied the
captain.</p>

<p>“Stop it, then!”</p>

<p>It was pointed out to the admiral that stopping
the propeller resulted as a rule in the stopping of the
ship likewise.</p>

<p>“Then take the thing off,” bellowed the naval autocrat,
“and put it on the other end.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>


<h3>ROUGH ON TOMMY</h3>

<p>The mails from home had just been received by
a certain regiment. Not only were there letters, but
many parcels from relatives and friends at home for
lucky soldiers. One of the Tommies received a large
box addressed to himself, and with a triumphant yell
he rushed off to his company’s lines and gathered
them around him to share in the eagerly anticipated
contents of his box.</p>

<p>“Smokes, lads!” he cried, as he undid the wrapping.
“From the old man; I knows it. An’ there’s sure to
be a bottle or two of Scotch.”</p>

<p>He opened the box, gave one look at the contents,
and collapsed in a heap.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried his comrades, pressing round.</p>

<p>“It’s from ole Auntie Mary,” groaned the disappointed
warrior. “Bandages an’ ointment an’ embrocation
an’ splints, an’ a book on ‘’Ow to be yer own
Surgin’!”</p>


<h3>NOT EXACTLY COMPLIMENTARY</h3>

<p>The company marched so poorly and went through
their drill so badly that the captain, who was of a
somewhat excitable nature, shouted indignantly at
the soldiers:—</p>

<p>“You knock-kneed, big-footed idiots, you are not
worthy of being drilled by a captain. What you
want is a rhinoceros to drill you, you wretched lot of
donkeys.”</p>

<p>Then, sheathing his sword indignantly, he added,
“Now, lieutenant, you take charge of them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE QUEEN, LIEUTENANT</h3>

<p>The sporty lieutenant, on being handed one of the
mufflers so thoughtfully sent out to English soldiers
at the Front by “Mary R.” representing the ladies of
the Empire, murmured:—</p>

<p>“I thought I knew every single one of the Empire
ladies, by sight at any rate; but dashed if I can remember
‘Mary R.’”</p>


<h3>FINE WORK</h3>

<p>The war bulletins, which used to announce the taking
of provinces and army corps, announce now the
taking of single trenches, or single farm-houses—they
announce, like a football game, gains of a few
yards.</p>

<p>It’s fine work, very fine work. It reminds one of
the jockey who was a trifle overweight—only a trifle,
mind; but this trifle was enough to disqualify him.</p>

<p>“James,” said his owner after the scales had told
their tale, “is there nothing more you can do?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Are you shaved and hair-cut?”</p>

<p>“Half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Nails?”</p>

<p>The jockey showed his nails. They were trimmed
to the quick.</p>

<p>“You’d better get your tonsils cut, James.”</p>

<p>But this, too, had been done.</p>

<p>“Well, then, James,” said the owner, “there’s nothing
for it but to have your appendix taken out.
Hurry off to the hospital now, or you’ll be too late.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<h3>NO CAUSE FOR FEAR</h3>

<p>A company of Territorials were at the range. The
usual marker had not turned up, but a deputy was
soon found in the person of an old worthy well-known
in the district who occasionally acted as substitute
in such circumstances. The first round was
about to be fired when the captain, looking towards
the target, was almost stupefied to see the newly-engaged
marker right in the line of fire.</p>

<p>“Stop firing!” he screeched, as he hastened to where
the old man stood, calmly smoking. “You blithering
idiot!” he yelled, as he approached. “Do you know
you were within an ace of death just now?”</p>

<p>“Ich, aye,” was the reply. “Jist fire awa’. A’ve
marked for your squad before.”</p>


<h3>GIVE AND TAKE</h3>

<p>A South African newspaper hears that much
badinage by wireless passes between English officers
at Luderitzbucht and the German officers at Windhuk.
The other day, so the story runs, the O. C. German
troops at Windhuk wirelessed down to a certain prominent
officer:</p>

<p>“Stop your men playing football and teach them
to drill instead; Kolmanskop will make a good parade
ground.”</p>

<p>That night a reconnoitering party went out to
Kolmanskop and killed four Germans and wounded
another. Colonel Blank thereupon wirelessed to
Windhuk:</p>

<p>“Took your advice; scored four goals and a try.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3>FUN ON THE FIRING-LINE</h3>

<p>The course of training for a recruit is not all
drudgery. Hardly a day passes without some amusing
incident happening. The following occurred a
few weeks ago in a Territorial regiment.</p>

<p>The day’s programme included practice in passing
messages from mouth to mouth all along the line. In
the roar of a battle it is very necessary that each
man should be able to pass on a message which could
not be heard if the officer in charge called it out. The
officer got the men in a firing position and whispered
the following message to the man on the left flank:—</p>

<p>“Left half company commander to right half company
commander—ammunition almost done; let us
have more quickly,” and ordered the message to be
passed to the right. In a few minutes he called up
the right-flank man and asked for the message as he
received it.</p>

<p>The reply was:—</p>

<p>“Ammunition all gone. God Save the King.”</p>

<p>There was very little order for a few minutes after
that.</p>


<h3>DOING HIS BIT</h3>

<p>Recruiting Sergeant—“Whose are these strapping
youths, and why aren’t they in the army?”</p>

<p>Farmer—“They be my sons, for sure.”</p>

<p>Recruiting Sergeant—“Good heavens, man! Aren’t
you doing anything for your country?”</p>

<p>Farmer—“In coorse I am. I sends two eggs
every week to the wounded soldiers at the horspital.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h3>WELCOME PRISONERS</h3>

<p>A captain of Hussars gave a dinner to the men of
his squadron the night before they left for the front.</p>

<p>“Now, my lads,” he said, “treat this dinner as you
will the enemy.”</p>

<p>And they set to with a will.</p>

<p>After dinner he discovered one of the men stowing
away bottles of champagne into a bag, and, highly
indignant, he demanded to know what he meant by
such conduct.</p>

<p>“I’m only obeying orders, sir,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Obeying orders!” roared the captain; “what do
you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“You told us to treat the dinner like the enemy,
sir, and when we meet the enemy, sir, those we don’t
kill we take prisoners.”</p>


<h3>HE KNEW THE ANSWER</h3>

<p>One of the best stories of regimental life told by
General Sir Archibald Hunter, the commander of England’s
third new army, concerns a certain “Tommy”
who was more noted for his wit than his scholarship.
The man’s grammar and spelling were simply awful,
and Sir Archibald was trying to teach him the King’s
English.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you know what w-o-m-a-n spells,”
said he to the uneducated soldier on one occasion.</p>

<p>“Trouble as a rule, sir,” replied “Tommy,” with
a grin.</p>

<p>Hunter was so amused that he was quite unable to
reprimand the man for his “cheek.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h3>A JOKE IN THE TRENCHES</h3>

<p>“Can anny av yer tell me why the Scots are the
most humane sojers at the front?” asked the Irish
sergeant, as he set light to his pipe.</p>

<p>“We give it up,” came the ready response from the
boys just returned from the trenches.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s bekase they always carry their kilt aff
the field.”</p>


<h3>HE KNEW WHERE IT WAS</h3>

<p>The drill instructor passed his hand wearily across
his forehead. He had been breaking in some raw
recruits and instructing them in the elements of company
drill.</p>

<p>The majority were intelligent fellows, and found
no difficulty in obeying his instructions; but one, in
particular, did not seem able to understand even a
simple order.</p>

<p>At last, losing his temper, the drill instructor determined
to bring him to his senses by holding him
up to ridicule. Calling him to the front he proceeded
to put him through his paces.</p>

<p>“Eyes front!” he roared.</p>

<p>To everybody’s astonishment the recruit gazed absent-mindedly
about him.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” bellowed the instructor,
“that you do not know where your front is?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, sir,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Well, then, where is it?” demanded the instructor.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” he faltered, “it’s gone to the laundry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>


<h3>SUPERIOR MARKSMANSHIP</h3>

<p>Pat was a witty young recruit, who was taking instruction
in marksmanship. The squad had finished
firing. Pat was brought to task for his poor shooting,
and told that he must do better at the next distance;
there were to be seven rounds of quick firing.</p>

<p>“Now, Pat,” the sergeant told him, “fire at target
number five.”</p>

<p>Pat banged away, and hit target number four seven
times in succession.</p>

<p>“What target did you aim at?” asked the irate
officer.</p>

<p>“Number five sor,” answered Pat.</p>

<p>“And you have hit number four every time.”</p>

<p>“Bedad, sor,” retorted Pat, “that would be a grand
thing in war. Sure, I might aim at a private and
hit a gin’ral!”</p>


<h3>NOT A THIRST IN THE LOT</h3>

<p>A soldier, charged with being drunk and disorderly,
mentioned, in extenuation of his offense, the fact that
he had been compelled to travel up from camp in
very bad company.</p>

<p>“What sort of company?” asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>“A lot of teetotallers!” was the startling response.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say teetotallers are bad company?”
thundered the magistrate. “I think they are
the best company for such as you!”</p>

<p>“Beggin’ your pardon, sor,” answered the prisoner,
“ye’re wrong, for I had a bottle of whisky and I had
to drink it all mesel’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<h3>HIS SKIRTS CLEAR</h3>

<p>A sturdy little Lancashire lad went to a recruiting
station to enlist.</p>

<p>He was much disappointed when the officer told
him he was too small and too young.</p>

<p>“Can’t you find me some job in th’ army what I
am big enough for?” anxiously asked the lad.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t, I’m sorry to say,” replied the officer.</p>

<p>As the lad turned sorrowfully away he said:</p>

<p>“Well, don’t blame me if th’ bloomin’ Germans lick
o’ t’ lot on yo’; that’s all!”</p>


<h3>SHEEP AND GOATS</h3>

<p>Life in the new Army teaches a man to look after
himself. This is especially true of the larger camps,
and the rule appears to be that “they shall take who
have the power and they shall keep who can.”</p>

<p>A story illustrative of this is told of one of the
Yorkshire regiments now in training. The cold
weather had led some of the men to forage for extra
blankets one night, and when next morning they were
warned that the colonel was coming round for kit
inspection they were too busy cleaning and preparing
to put matters right again. The result was that when
the men paraded some of them had three or four blankets
while others had no blanket at all.</p>

<p>The colonel noticed this in his inspection, but said
no word until he had been wholly round. Then, drawing
himself up in front of the men, he thundered:—</p>

<p>“Ahem, major, one-half the regiment are simple
fools, and the other half are bloomin’ thieves.”</p>

<h3>JOGGING HIS MEMORY</h3>

<p>Readers of the War news who have some difficulty
in remembering where the Falkland Islands are may
be helped by the recollection of one of Ian Maclaren’s
stories. After a disaster to an emigrant ship many
years ago, some of the survivors reached those islands.
When the news came home the minister of a Scottish
church to which some of the emigrants had belonged
prayed thus:—</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, we pray Thee to be with our brethren,
stranded in the Falkland Islands, which, as Thou
knowest, are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean.”</p>


<h3>WILLING TO COMPROMISE</h3>

<p>“Well, Tom, what d’ye think o’ this prohibition
business?”</p>

<p>“We ought to do like France and Russia.”</p>

<p>“You’re givin’ it all up, then?”</p>

<p>“No; France is givin’ up absent and Russia’s
givin’ up vodka. So I’m not goin’ to touch absent
or vodka till peace comes. Give me beer.”</p>


<h3>BRINGING IN THE NEW YEAR<br />

Seaforth Highlanders’ Quaint Ceremony</h3>

<p>The Seaforth Highlanders, now at the front, have
one of the most peculiar New Year’s Eve customs of
the whole British Army. The ceremony is picturesque
and imposing.</p>

<p>On the night of Hogmanay, at about half-past ten,
the regiment assembles in the barrack square. A few
minutes later the oldest soldier in the battalion, dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
up as a druid, makes his appearance, to the accompaniment
of a flourish of trumpets, and ascending
the improvised throne, he calls on the ancient veterans
to show their uniforms and achievements of bygone
times. To the music of the pipes and brass band,
veteran after veteran, arrayed in the uniforms worn
by the regiment at different periods, marches past,
and salutes the druid. The druid then toasts “The
Seaforth Highlanders.”</p>

<p>After a display of Highland dancing, the alarm is
sounded, and the second oldest soldier, arrayed as
Father Time, approaches. The veterans now retreat,
leaving their honors to be guarded by their successors,
and Father Time expels the druid.</p>

<p>At the last stroke of midnight a loud knock is heard
at the gate, and out rings the sentry’s challenge,
“Halt! Who goes there?”</p>

<p>“The New Year!” comes back the answer.</p>

<p>“Advance, New Year, and give the countersign!” is
the next command.</p>

<p>“Cabar feidth gu brath!” (the clan cry of the
Mackenzies, i. e., the Seaforths).</p>

<p>“Pass, New Year; all’s well!”</p>

<p>The gate is then opened, and the youngest boy of
the battalion enters, dressed as the high chief of ancient
Ross, to represent the New Year. The colonel
shakes hands with the boy, while the band strikes up
“A Guid New Year to Ane and A’.”</p>

<p>After the colonel’s greeting to the battalion the
National Anthem is played, and the men fall out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<h3>A WOMAN’S WORRY</h3>

<p>Mrs. Barron was paying a visit to Mrs. Atkins,
whose husband was away fighting at the front. The
visitor found the soldier’s wife in a paroxysm of grief.</p>

<p>“Whatever is the matter?” exclaimed Mrs. Barron.</p>

<p>“Aint yer heard?” was the sobbing reply. “Bill’s
in ’orspital with both ’is arms off.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Barron was obviously shocked. With a view
to easing the grief, however, she said:</p>

<p>“But the Government will be sure to provide for
you.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t it,” was the tearful response. “Who’s
a-goin’ to turn the mangle for me on washin’ days
now, I’d like ter know?”</p>


<h3>NOT SUPPLIES ENOUGH FOR TWO</h3>

<p>When a talk about the German invasion of England
was going on, an Irish militiaman, stationed in Carrickfergus,
was heard to remark that immediately the
enemy landed in England he would certainly bolt,
taking a good stock of provisions, and hide in a
convenient cave he knew of.</p>

<p>The colonel, hearing of his unpatriotic resolve,
called him out next day on parade, and lectured him
severely on his cowardice.</p>

<p>“You’re a disgrace to the regiment and the Service
at large,” he cried. “Fancy you threatening to run
away; but I’d be after you in quick time, my man,
never fear.”</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ you’d be welcome, your honor; but,
bring yer own praties an’ things, won’t yer, colonel?”</p>

<h3>LOVE-LETTER TO A RED CROSS NURSE</h3>

<p class='right'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Somewhere in Europe,</span><br />
Some Day in December, 1915.<br />
</p>

<p>My Dearest Nursie: I suppose I am the same chap
who got drilled through the wing rib by a German
bullet about a century since? That I haven’t been
in heaven, and, not being up to sample, have been
shunted to hades? Don’t mistake me, nursie. I’m
jolly glad to have another go at the dog that bit me.
But last time I left for the front I took my heart
with me, and this time I have left it behind in old
England.</p>

<p>I owe the Germans a grudge, but I owe them a
vote of thanks, too. They introduced us, nursie. I
didn’t know what living meant until I was wounded
and met you. Wounded! Why, my dearest nursie,
the wound you dressed so tenderly was a mere flea-bite
to the one the first sight of you, a Red Cross
angel, hovering about my bed, made bang through
my heart.</p>

<p>As you know, heart wounds are generally fatal—kill
a chap as dead as pork; but, as I have already
said, I have found it just the other way about. My
heart wound has given me new life, new hope, new
courage, a new and better manhood.</p>

<p>I have always foolishly regarded women as the
weaker sex, but great Kitchener! the Man Killers the
Germans can produce and use are nothing to yours,
either in range, number, or effectiveness. You take
a man prisoner with one glance of your eyes, you put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
him hopelessly out of action with a quiver of your
lip, you leave him dead to everything in earth or sky
but your own sweet self with one touch of your dear
hand, and you make him your eternal vassal and slave
with the flicker of a smile.</p>

<p>Melinite is a fool to the galvanic thrill the mere
sound of your fairy footstep approaching my bed or
my chair used to give me every morning. The German
“Black Marias” are mere popguns to the batteries
of your sweet eyes, masked at times by their
fringed lashes. The German bayonets even at their
best cannot begin to compete with the wounds your
gentle tongue can inflict by a sharp rebuke, and a
charge of Uhlans is nothing to the overwhelming
charge of love which sweeps through the ranks of my
heart when I think of you.</p>

<p>But though I laid siege to your heart, and brought
up all the guns and reinforcements I could muster,
and although I pride myself on having, by your own
confession, captured a few of the outer ring of forts,
such as Friendship, Regard, Good Wishes, and Interest,
yet I’m horridly afraid that your heart’s real affections
are still unconquered.</p>

<p>Oh, nursie, I cannot believe that your heart is solid
concrete. There’s surely a soft core if I could only
get at it. But you can’t prevent me writing. It’s
raining in torrents, but rain cannot damp my ardor.
The enemy is firing all his big guns at once, but they
cannot drive your image from the deep trenches of
my soul. There is an aeroplane overhead, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
chap in it does not feel half so uplifted as I do when
I think of our last handshake—shall it be a kiss when
We meet?—and he would not feel half so cast down,
even if he were crashing to earth with a broken wing,
as I shall if you do not reply soon.</p>

<p>Nursie, say “Yes” for Christmas, there’s a love!</p>

<p>With my life’s devotion,</p>

<p class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Your late patient and grateful convalescent,</span><br />
THOMAS ATKINS.<br />
</p>

<p>P. S.—I think you are sufficiently interested in my
welfare to be glad to hear that I received my commission
yesterday, and that our colonel put me to
shame before all the chaps by saying all sorts of bosh
about a little job I did last week.</p>

<p>P. P. S.—Nursie, a little word of three letters—three,
mind—by return will make me prouder and
happier than if I had been made a field-marshal.</p>


<h3>HOW HEROES ARE MADE</h3>

<p>The Germans came down in force upon a patrol of
Lancers, who were obliged to retire. One man, however,
fell wounded in the thigh, and would have been
captured had not a comrade turned back and brought
him in under a heavy fire.</p>

<p>“Well done, Mac,” said his captain at the close of
the fray; “that was a plucky action of yours in bringing
Private Johnson in under fire.”</p>

<p>“Weel, sir,” replied Mac, “ye see, he’s the only
box o’ matches in the whole bloomin’ troop, an’ what’d
we do without oor wee bit smoke?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>


<h3>ANNOUNCED HIS ARRIVAL</h3>

<p>The proud father had come up from the country
to see his sailor son on board his ship. He had never
seen a battleship before, and accordingly marvelled
thereat.</p>

<p>Just as he caught hold of the two ropes which hung
over the side to assist sailors to the deck, he was somewhat
surprised to hear a clanging of bells—the eight
bells of seamen’s time.</p>

<p>As he stepped on deck he met the officer of the
watch. He saluted him and said, timidly:</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, I’ve come to see my son
Jack, but, ’pon my word, I didn’t mean to ring so
loud.”</p>


<h3>STEPPED ON IT</h3>

<p>A certain Staffordshire regiment had a very small
band; but the commanding officer’s feet were—well,
rather broad. One day the regiment was to march
out on parade, but the music was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>“Where on earth is the band?” queried the adjutant.</p>

<p>For some time there was no reply; but when the
question was repeated, a gruff voice from the rear
rank said:</p>

<p>“I believe, sor, the colonel trod on it be accident!”</p>


<h3>KING ALBERT’S CHIVALRY<br />

Calls Husband to His Wife from Trenches</h3>

<p>A young Parisian lady, newly married to a French
artillery officer who had fought through the battles
of the Marne and the Aisne and is now at the Front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in Flanders, determined to see her husband at all
costs.</p>

<p>She left Paris for Dunkirk and tried vainly at the
French headquarters to secure a pass. She was, however,
not beaten. She travelled in a peasant’s country
cart and with many delays to the Belgian headquarters.</p>

<p>Taking her courage in both hands, she explained
her mission, gained access to the officers of the headquarters
staff, and put forward her request.</p>

<p>The officers received her with great politeness, listened
to her story sympathetically, and told her gently
that what she asked was impossible.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a tall young officer who had
been intently studying a map turned to the lady.
“Madame,” he said, “you shall see your husband.”
Then he spoke for a few moments through the telephone,
and, turning again to the young wife, said,
“If you will wait a little while, your husband will
come to you.”</p>

<p>With tears streaming down her cheeks she seized
his hands and thanked him warmly for his kindness.</p>

<p>Two hours later there was a joyous meeting between
the lady and her husband, who had been bewildered
by his sudden recall from the trenches in the
midst of a battle.</p>

<p>His wife explained how it had all come about, and
described the officer through whose kindness the meeting
had been made possible.</p>

<p>“That was King Albert,” said her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>


<h3>FULLY QUALIFIED</h3>

<p>Quite recently a man appeared at the recruiting
offices in Newcastle and stated to the officer in charge
that he wished to enlist into His Majesty’s Army.</p>

<p>“Well, my man, what regiment do you prefer to
join?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the recruit, “I should like to join
the cavalry.”</p>

<p>“Cavalry,” repeated the head of the recruiting department.
“All right, my man, do you know anything
about horses?”</p>

<p>“Do I know anything about horses?” replied the
would-be recruit, seriously. “Why, I backed a winner
and two seconds yesterday!”</p>


<h3>A FINE SIGHT FOR THE HUNGRY</h3>

<p>The men of a certain regiment had made some complaints
respecting the scarcity of food, but the colonel,
a strong believer in the go-away-from-the-table-hungry
maxim, saw no grounds for increasing the
supply.</p>

<p>At last, however, the climax came.</p>

<p>The gunnery instructor had one day been explaining
to a squad of men the advantages of different
sights, when the colonel appeared on the scene and
began to ask questions on the subject.</p>

<p>“Can any of you men tell me what a fine sight is?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” came the reply from a private.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>The private saluted. “Two dinners, sir, on one
plate,” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<h3>SERVIAN WOMEN</h3>

<p>There is no country in the world where women occupy
a more dignified or honored position in the home
than Servia. The Servian idea is quite different from
that of the Turk, who keeps his women behind shut
doors, or the German, whose ideal woman is a good
<i>hausfrau</i>. In Servia the woman is the companion of
the man.</p>

<p>A man is responsible for his unmarried sisters, and
throughout the Balkan States it is considered rather
a breach of etiquette for him to marry before his
older sister.</p>

<p>No Servian girl would feel she could hold up her
head in society unless she could speak four languages.
There is hardly a Servian woman who cannot play
some musical instrument. Embroidery, painting,
drawing and sculpture are all studied.</p>

<p>Servian women are very domesticated, and the highest
ladies pay personal attention to trivial matters
of housekeeping.</p>

<p>There are two women doctors practicing in Belgrade,
and women teachers galore. But public opinion
on the whole is rather against women entering the
labor market.</p>


<h3>SECOND THOUGHT BEST</h3>

<p>“Every time I see grandfather’s sword and medals,”
said Bill, “I long to take part in a universal war.”
Then, as an afterthought, Bill said, “But every time
I look at grandfather’s wooden leg I long for the advent
of universal peace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>


<h3>PUNISHED FOR HIS NAME</h3>

<p>It was the drilling of a squad of recruits. The
officer was calling the names, and prompt replies came
from Jones and Smith and Robinson.</p>

<p>The next name was Montaig—that was how the
officer pronounced it.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>“Montaig,” repeated the officer with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” came the half-hearted reply from the
rear rank.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you answer at once?” said the man
in charge.</p>

<p>“My name is Montague,” said the recruit.</p>

<p>“Is it?” replied the officer. “Well, you do seven
days’ fatigew.”</p>


<h3>THEIR OWN PRIVATE WARFARE</h3>

<p>One day recently a colonel in a newly-recruited
North-country battalion had occasion to reprimand
severely one of his men. Next day, passing this same
recruit, who was doing sentry duty, the colonel observed
he did not receive the usual salute. After intentionally
passing him a second and third time with
the same omission each time on the part of the sentry,
the following conversation took place:—</p>

<p>Colonel—“Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>Recruit—“Yes.”</p>

<p>Colonel—“Do you not know you ought to salute
me, or any other officer when he passes you?”</p>

<p>Recruit—“Aye; but then thee and me fell out yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h3>A BIT OF RUSSIAN WIT</h3>

<p>Aide-de-Camp to Grand Duke Nicholas—“We have
just captured a motor-car containing a German of
very high rank. We think it is the Kaiser.”</p>

<p>Grand Duke—“For heaven’s sake release him at
once. He is our best asset in the field. He always
gives the wrong instructions and interferes at the
wrong moment.”</p>


<h3>ARMORED CANADIAN SOLDIERS</h3>

<p>Like knights of old, the Canadian troops for the
front are equipped with armor. It is in the form
of a spade, to be carried on the back when not in use,
to be used for digging trenches when not wanted for
protective purposes, and to act as a shield and rifle-rest
when the fighting begins.</p>

<p>There is an oval hole in the middle of the blade
of the spade. Through this hole the soldier pokes
his rifle, just as the archers in the old days used narrow
niches in the walls of a castle.</p>

<p>Although the spade weighs only four pounds, and
can be carried on marches with ease, it is practically
bullet-proof. For hours at Valcartier Camp Sergeant
Hawkins, the King’s prize-winner, potted at
the spades with his rifle, but it was not until he shot
at 200 yards with Mark 7 ammunition that the spades
were damaged at all. Then they were only cracked.</p>

<p>Bullets just shattered against the shields and fell
back, shapeless. A company of the 1st Royal Montreal
Regiment fired volleys at the spades, without
piercing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>


<h3>TRYING HARD TO GET BY</h3>

<p>A recruit, well known for his “strategy” when seeking
a holiday, went to the doctor and asked for a
note, as he said he was ill. The doctor could not find
anything wrong with him, but gave him a note, and
just marked a stroke where the nature of complaint
should be. He went to the chief officer with the note
and asked for leave. The officer took the note, looked
at it, and then said (for he looked puzzled):</p>

<p>“What is this you are suffering from? I can’t tell.”</p>

<p>Then our friend took the note, looked at it, and
confidently replied:</p>

<p>“Can’t you see, sir, that it’s a stroke I’m suffering
from?”</p>


<h3>ONLY ONE ROCK</h3>

<p>At a certain British club the other day the possibility
of providing soldiers with some form of bullet-proof
protection was being discussed.</p>

<p>“Those bullet-proof shields are an insult to Tommy’s’
dignity, gentlemen,” inveighed a retired military
man, whose oft-boasted achievements no living
person had ever seen recorded.</p>

<p>“What do they want with such feminine accessories?
When I was out in India my force faced a
galling fire for two hours, and there was no shelter
but a little rock for miles; yet though hundreds fell
on every side of me, I came off without a scratch.”</p>

<p>“That’s an argument in favor of shields,” quietly
commented a fellow-clubman. “If there had been
more rocks some of the men might have escaped too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>


<h3>SOUNDS LIKE A TOWN</h3>

<p>Fogarty (a moderate drinker): “I’ll bet ye th’
Rooshians are beginnin’ t’ feel th’ loss iv vodka.”</p>

<p>Flaherty (warmly): “Don’t ye lose any slape over
it. Mar-rk me wur-ruds, they’ll retake it agin before
long!”</p>


<h3>THE BISHOP’S PRISONER</h3>

<p>The Bishop of London discharges his duties in
camp as the chaplain of the London Rifle Brigade
very thoroughly. One morning a number of men
were out scouting, and a recruit, very well up in his
drill, took advantage of passing through a wood to
loiter behind and have a surreptitious “smoke” behind
a clump of trees. He was discovered by the
bishop, who, as chaplain, is, of course, an officer of
the regiment.</p>

<p>The bishop gave the rifleman a good wigging as
to his dereliction of duty, and reminded him that
he ought really to be the bishop’s prisoner. The
rifleman stood at the salute, and, expressing his penitence,
the offense was overlooked.</p>

<p>The rifleman, who stands well over six feet, in telling
the story, says, “That’s the second time I have
been personally addressed by the bishop. The first
time was some ten years ago, when I was top boy in
our parish church choir, and after a service the bishop
patted me on the shoulder and commended me for my
solo singing! I little thought then that the day would
come when I should be his Lordship’s prisoner for my
solo <i>smoking</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<h3>NECESSARY PRECAUTION</h3>

<p>He was a very raw recruit, and was paying his
first visit to the riding school. He was allotted a
horse; but it was obvious, from the nervous way he
handled the animal, that he had never been on horseback
before. When the instructor came up the recruit
pointed to the girth.</p>

<p>“What’s it got that strap round it for?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed the instructor, with mock admiration,
“Fancy you noticing that. You see, that horse
has a terrible keen sense of humor, an’ he’s subject to
sudden bursts of laughter at some of the recruits he
gets; so we puts that band round him to keep him
from bursting his sides.”</p>


<h3>STOPPING THE DONKEY</h3>

<p>He was instructing some recruits in the mysteries
of marching movements. After explaining and illustrating
his remarks several times he approached one
recruit, looked at him silently for a couple of seconds,
then demanded his name.</p>

<p>“Fitzgerald, sorr,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Did you ever drive a donkey, Fitzgerald?” was
his next inquiry.</p>

<p>“Yes, sorr,” was the man’s reply.</p>

<p>“What did you say when you wanted him to stop?”</p>

<p>“Whoa.”</p>

<p>The sergeant turned away and immediately put his
squad in motion again. The men advanced a dozen
yards or so, when he rasped out:</p>

<p>“Squad, halt! Whoa, Fitzgerald!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>


<h3>ONE ON SCOTTY</h3>

<p>Some friends were in a restaurant the other day
discussing the war, when a Scotsman at the next table
remarked:</p>

<p>“The Alleys are doing verra weel, ar-ren’t they?”</p>

<p>One, thinking to be smart, said:</p>

<p>“The Alleys! Whom do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said the Scotsman, “the French and the
Scotch, of course.”</p>

<p>At this the friends roared with laughter.</p>

<p>“Aye, you can laugh!” said the Scot. “But I saw
my mistake as soon as I spoke. I should have said the
Scotch and the French.”</p>


<h3>DEFYING THE KAISER</h3>

<p>In a fit of impatience because the speed of his
yacht was slowed down on entering a certain harbor,
the German Emperor on one occasion tried to assert
his authority, and rang the bell for “Full speed
ahead.” To his great surprise, the pilot, an old Norwegian
named Nordhuns, who knew the dangerous
character of the channel, placed himself in the way,
and, leaning over the wheel, called down the tube to
the engine-room, “Half-speed ahead. Never mind the
bell!”</p>

<p>“What! You dare to countermand my orders?”
cried the Kaiser, again ringing the bell.</p>

<p>“Disregard the bell,” calmly repeated Nordhuns
through the tube.</p>

<p>For a moment the Kaiser glared at the intrepid
pilot, and then, drawing himself up to his full height,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
said, majestically, “Go below, sir, and report yourself
under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Leave the bridge!” thundered the Norwegian,
grimly, as he grasped the wheel more firmly. “This
ship is in my charge, and I’ll have no interference
with my orders from Kaiser or seaman!”</p>

<p>The officers on deck hurried silently aft, wishing
luck to the sturdy old sea-dog, who, knowing that
he had the law as well as common sense on his side,
stood at his post unshaken by threats, unheeding commands,
and steered the <i>Hohenzollern</i> safely into port.</p>

<p>The next day the Kaiser came to his senses, and
decorated the pilot—the king at the wheel—with one
grade of the Order of the Black Eagle, and also appointed
him his life pilot in Norwegian waters.</p>


<h3>TEMPERATURE 120°</h3>

<p>Private Tommy Sims had had pneumonia, and had
been for some time in hospital, where they treated
him so well that he was much averse to the prospect
of being discharged as “cured.” One day the doctor
was taking his temperature, and while Tommy
had the thermometer in his mouth the doctor moved
on, and happened to turn his back. Tommy saw his
chance. He pulled the thermometer out of his mouth
and popped it into a cup of hot tea, replacing it at
the first sign of the medico’s turning. When that
worthy examined the thermometer he looked first at
Tommy and then back at the thermometer and gasped:</p>

<p>“Well, my man, you’re not dead, but you ought
to be!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>


<h3>BUT PERHAPS HE CAN DIG TRENCHES</h3>

<p>The subaltern was being put through an examination
in geography, wherein he proved himself astonishingly
ignorant. At last, after a failure on his part
of unusual flagrance, the examiner scowled at him and
thundered:—</p>

<p>“Idiot, you want to defend your country, and you
don’t know where it is!”</p>


<h3>LATEST SCOUTING STORY</h3>

<p>One of the most dangerous duties a scout is called
upon to perform in war-time is that of ascertaining
whether some particular position is or is not occupied
by the enemy’s forces. Every scout has his own
methods of working, but the first thing each does is
generally to attempt to trap the hidden men into betraying
their position.</p>

<p>The other day a British scout, who, previous to
the outbreak of war, had been a well-known man
about town, was told to examine a little wood on the
right bank of the ——. He went forward and
tried all the usual artifices, including the somewhat
threadbare one of pretending to gallop away in alarm,
but in vain. Not a German showed himself. Yet the
scout was not satisfied, and suddenly a bright thought
struck him. He advanced a few paces and, jingling
some loose silver in his pocket, roared out:</p>

<p>“Waiter! Get me a taxi!”</p>

<p>“Yessir! Cert’n’y, sir!” came the reply from some
twenty or thirty German soldiers. Force of habit
had proved too much for bonds of discipline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHINESE SYMPATHY</h3>

<p>The other day a British reservist living in Montreal
with his wife and family received the call to join the
colors immediately. He decided to take his wife and
children to England to stay during his absence. He
found the most convenient arrangement would mean
leaving Montreal the following day. But it was midweek,
and the family wash was at the Chinaman’s.
The lady went over to the laundry. The “boys”
shook their heads—the wash would not be sorted out
before Saturday. But just then the boss laundry-man
came in.</p>

<p>“Your husband going to the war? Velly brave
man. Me work all night to get your laundry.”</p>

<p>Next morning it was brought home by the “boss”
himself.</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Your husband go to the war. If you
stay here all winter me wash all the clothes for the
family. Not a cent.”</p>


<h3>GIVING HIM A SEND-OFF</h3>

<p>A curious incident was witnessed in a tram-car in
a Yorkshire town a day or two back. Two women
were seated side by side in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>“So tha’s been to see him off?” said one.</p>

<p>“Aye,” replied the other. “Ah’ve been to see him
off. Eh, dear, but I didna know what to say to him.
So I says, ‘Well, good-bye, old lad,’ I says, ’an if tha
thoomps t’ Kaiser as tha’s thoomped me he’ll be sorry
he went to war!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>


<h3>SHE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE</h3>

<p>“Some of our cannon are disappearing,” remarked
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Well, things will disappear when you have careless
help,” responded the lady who was going over
the fort. “I find that a great trouble about keeping
house.”</p>


<h3>WHERE WAR IS NOT HELL</h3>

<p>Chatty Neighbor—“I suppose you don’t stand for
any war arguments among your boarders?”</p>

<p>Boarding House Mistress—“O, yes. You see, our
biggest eater gets so interested that he forgets to eat
and our next biggest eater gets so mad that he leaves
before the meal is half over.”</p>


<h3>FEROCITY EXPLAINED</h3>

<p>Bill—“I read as ’ow that ’ere ’Indenburg ’as got
an English wife.”</p>

<p>Alf—“Ah, that accounts for ’is fightin’ like ’e
does.”</p>


<h3>COULDN’T BE SCOTCH</h3>

<p>Barman—“Strikes me, there’s one o’ these blooming
German spies in the smoke-room, sir. ’E’s bragging
about bein’ a Scotsman, and the whisky I took ’im a
quarter of an hour ago ’e ain’t even touched yet.”</p>


<h3>HARDLY HIS FAULT</h3>

<p>Officer (severely)—“Is this rifle supposed to have
been cleaned?”</p>

<p>Recent Recruit—“Well, sir—yes. But you know
what these servant gals are!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE GERMANS ABASHED</h3>

<p>A British naval officer, home on short leave, told a
North Sea story. “We had taken some prisoners
aboard, three of them officers; one of their torpedoes
had missed us by nearly ten feet.</p>

<p>“We made the officers as comfortable as we could,
gave them food and drink, and talked about ordinary
general matters; hardly a word was said about the
fight.</p>

<p>“The Germans seemed ill at ease, suspicious. At
last one of them said, ‘We don’t understand you
treating us like this. We tried to torpedo you.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, that’s all right; that’s over now,’ said a navigating
lieutenant, handing him a cigarette.</p>

<p>“‘We’d like to show you that we appreciate your
goodness,’ went on the German.</p>

<p>“There was a long pause. Then the lieutenant
burst in with great cheerfulness, ‘Well, sing us the
“Hymn of Hate.”’</p>

<p>“That was one of the rare moments when I have
seen German officers look abashed.”</p>


<h3>LOCATING PROGRESS</h3>

<p>As a young man was walking along reading the
evening newspaper he was accosted by an old lady
who seemed interested in the war.</p>

<p>“Any news from the front, young man?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Not much,” he replied. “Big battle in progress.”</p>

<p>“Well, thank heaven,” she said, “that it’s not in
Belgium, where my poor Johnnie is gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>


<h3>HOW I ESCAPED FROM BERLIN<br />

Supposed to Be Written by Mrs. Malaprop</h3>

<p>’Tis very easy to ask me for an account of my
escape from Berlin, but when one has been hustled
and fluted and prosecuted as I have, it is a wonder
that one’s brain is not totally disinterred. However,
in spite of my adventitious experiments, I am still,
thank heaven! <i>compote mentis</i>, and can give a strictly
voracious prescription of my sufferings. Like Othello,
I will “nothing exterminate, nor set up aught in
malice.”</p>

<p>You may require what I was doing in the great
Prussian necropolis. The fact is that after the fatigues
of the season I found myself somewhat interposed.
I am the last person to give way to a fit of
the vapors, but my enemy, the gout, had made such
invidious advances and become so chromatic that I
was advised to go and reciprocate under the care of
a prominent Berlin physician. Despite the diversion
which I naturally feel for all Germans, I must admit
that his treatment and regiment proved beneficent—though
his fees were exuberant—and I was rapidly
recovering when the declaration of war burst upon
us like a cataplasm.</p>

<p>Berlin was at once in a state of convolution. The
streets were crowded with people in a very succulent
humor, waving flags, singing typical songs, and
shouting remarks which deluded recognition, as my
knowledge of the language is merely superfluous. Any
attempt at leaving the house was not only fertile but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
periculous, as Englishmen were subjugated to various
forms of contumacy, either because the police were
useless or with their secret contrivance.</p>

<p>I protest I never saw such a panharmonium! Foreign
residents had their windows stoned, and abstained
many cuts and confusions from the missals. The
proprietor of our boarding-house was not actually
indolent, but treated me in a very caviare manner,
advising me to speak no English. Even neuters, he
told me, were being distrained to stimulate a factious
enthusiasm for the Kaiser.</p>

<p>Next day an official arrived. He asked me if I was
English. “Sir,” I replied, “I am no camellia, changing
my colors to suit my surroundings.” I think he
hardly depreciated my semaphore; he merely told me
to pack my trunks in readiness to leave Berlin at a
certain hour next day. After another sleepless night
passed in anxious participations, four of us were convoyed
to the station in a closed vehicle and left for
hours on a platform crowded to supplication with
fugitives. Some of the women wept quietly, while
others gave way to historical outbursts. They gave
us nothing but water, and I was induced to eating
some digestible chocolate caravans produced by my
maid.</p>

<p>At last the aliens’ train arrived; but we were at
the back of the crowd, and you may imagine my
constellation when I discovered that every department
had its full quotient of passengers. Seizing a passing
official, I exclaimed: “Thou transcendental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Triton, is it thus that the confidential visitors, whose
gold gorges the coffins of thy treasury, and who patiently
suffer the ubiquitous distortions of thy greedy
countrymen, are rewarded? Fie, sir! It is larceny—tyranny—barometry
of the vilest conscription!”</p>

<p>He seemed puzzled, and said, roughly: “Are you
Suffer-gette?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” I replied, “I will endure no more obliquity.
I will say no more. I refuse to omit another syllabus.”</p>

<p>He called another official, and after a long discursion,
during which they regarded me very strangely,
frequently tapping their foreheads, they had a horse-box
corrected to the train, into which my maid and
I were inducted, attended by a German female. I
passed the journey in a sort of comma, and eventually
reached England, which it is my firm resolution never
to leave again.</p>


<h3>PERMANENTLY POSTPONED</h3>

<p>The Irish Guards were holding a position at Ypres,
and flying bullets were the order of the day. The
Germans endeavored to break through, and after a
particularly brisk volley Private Flynn was heard to
shout:—</p>

<p>“Murder of wars, I’m done now altogether!”</p>

<p>“Why, have you been hit?” shouts Captain P——.</p>

<p>“Not entoirely hit, sir,” shouts Flynn; “but I’ve
been waiting this ten minutes for a smoke from Murtagh’s
pipe, and by the powers they’ve just shot it
out iv his mouth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<h3>UNINTENTIONAL LIMITATION</h3>

<p>The vicar of S——— is very patriotic, and has
done a great deal of recruiting in his own and the
adjoining parishes. He is also very absent-minded.
This was never so forcibly brought home to him as
on the occasion of the young squire’s wedding. The
squire’s regiment was leaving almost immediately for
the front, consequently the wedding attracted more
than ordinary interest, and the little church was
crowded to its utmost capacity.</p>

<p>The ceremony proceeded without a hitch, the momentous
words had been spoken by the vicar, and repeated
by the bridegroom ... “take thee,
Phyllis, to my wedded wife,” when the congregation
were astounded by the next words from the vicar, “for
three years or the duration of the war.”</p>


<h3>NOTHING NEW TO HIM</h3>

<p>It was company field-training. The captain saw
a young soldier trying to cook his breakfast with a
badly-made fire. Going to him, he showed him how
to make a quick-cooking fire, saying:</p>

<p>“Look at the time you are wasting. When I was
on the West Coast I often had to hunt my breakfast.
I used to go about two miles in the jungle, shoot my
food, skin or pluck it, then cook and eat it, and return
to the camp under the half-hour.” Then he unwisely
added, “Of course, you have heard of the West
Coast?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the young soldier, “and also
of Ananias and Baron Munchausen, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>


<h3>ENGLISH HUMOR</h3>

<p>Bill—“Have you heard about the Prince of
Wales?”</p>

<p>Nell—“No. What of His Royal Highness?”</p>

<p>Bill—“Well, he had a fall, and remained unconscious
for some hours.”</p>

<p>Nell—“Oh, poor Prince!”</p>

<p>Bill—“But I am happy to say when His Royal
Highness came to himself he was none the worse.”</p>

<p>Nell—“How did it happen?”</p>

<p>Bill—“In this way (not officially denied): It was
very late on Monday; he fell—asleep in his bed!”</p>


<h3>NOT A CARUSO</h3>

<p>“Proud of ’im, I am,” announced an old lady,
whose son had just enlisted, to a knot of friends in
the village street. “Always done ’is duty by me, ’e ’as,
an’ now ’e’s doin’ ’is duty by King an’ country. I
feel right down sorry for them poor Germans to
think of ’im goin’ into battle with ’is rifle in ’is ’and
an’ ‘It’s a long way to Tipperary’ on ’is lips.”</p>

<p>“Poor Germans, indeed!” exclaimed one of her audience.
“Pity’s wasted on ’em. P’r’aps you ’aven’t
’eard of their cruelties?”</p>

<p>“P’r’aps I ’aven’t,” agreed the old lady, “an’ p’r’aps
you ’aven’t ’eard George sing!”</p>


<h3>IN WAR TIME</h3>

<p>Short-sighted Customer—“Aren’t you making your
rolls a little larger these days, Mr. Baker?”</p>

<p>“What! R-r-rolls? Them’s loaves!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>


<h3>GAVE THE SNAP AWAY</h3>

<p>Amongst some recruits waiting to be passed by the
doctor for a Tyneside battalion was a miner from a
local colliery, a fine strapping youth. After a good
many had been examined, it came to Geordie’s turn,
and everyone present thought him a likely recruit.
The doctor, after looking at Geordie’s teeth, remarked
sadly:—</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, my lad, I cannot pass you; your teeth
are too bad.”</p>

<p>“Wey, if this isn’t a licker,” replied Geordie. “Ye
passed th’ same teeth yisterday wi’ Bill Smith, an’
we both borrowed them.”</p>


<h3>WITHOUT PRECEDENT</h3>

<p>A certain Yorkshire soldier, who was badly wounded
in the jaw at Mons by a German bullet, was, on his
return home, relating to an interested group how his
company tackled the enemy when the order to charge
was given.</p>

<p>“Bullets was flyin’ like snowflakes,” he said; “an’
lots o’ our chaps was hit.”</p>

<p>“Weel, Tommy,” interrupted one of his listeners,
“couldn’t ye hear t’ bullets whizzin’ an’ makin’ a noise
as they was comin’ along, an’ so be able to get out
o’ their way?”</p>

<p>Tommy gave the inquirer a withering look, then
replied:</p>

<p>“Nay, lad, we couldn’t hear ’em comin’, becos them
bullets was Dum-Dum ’uns; an’ did anybody ever
hear of aught that was dumb makin’ a noise?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>


<h3>AN AGREEABLE MISTAKE</h3>

<p>The soldier of four months was recounting his experience
of “living on the country” in an Eastern
county. He and a comrade had been dispatched with
a motor-car to perform a certain mission. After traveling
a considerable distance they sighted an inn sign,
and, running the car into the yard at the rear, alighted
and entered by a back door. A picturesque dame appeared,
to whom the bluff and hearty spokesman said:</p>

<p>“Now, mother, is there anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Well, you can have some nice cold beef, and if
you like to wait half an hour I’ll cook you some potatoes
and a cauliflower.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Worth waiting for, that is, mother!
Right-o!” said the soldier.</p>

<p>She smiled approvingly, and told them to go into
her own parlor. In due course they were bidden to
the feast, over which they were glad to have her preside,
for she talked very entertainingly. Eventually
the spokesman broached the question of payment.</p>

<p>“Now, then, mother, how much do we owe you,
please?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing! I’m sure I’ve been very glad to have
you.”</p>

<p>“But, look here! I’d never have come in ordering
stuff to eat without expecting to pay for it. You
know you can’t keep a ‘pub.’ open on dinners for
naught! Now, can you, mother?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t, my dear lad! I don’t try to. This
isn’t the pub. It’s the house next door!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>


<h3>INCONSIDERATE BEGGAR</h3>

<p>“What do you think?” exclaimed Mrs. Twobble.
“While the Belgian Relief Committee was holding an
important meeting yesterday afternoon in my drawing-room
a ragged woman came to the house and
asked for food. She had a baby in her arms, too!”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” asked Mrs. Gadson.</p>

<p>“Sent her about her business, of course! I was
reading my report to the committee and had no time
to bother with stray beggars.”</p>


<h3>WHAT THE PILOT KNEW</h3>

<p>Owing to the safeguards which the Admiralty have
placed at the entrance to all large British seaports,
it is now compulsory for all outward-bound and incoming
vessels to be under the charge of a Government
pilot.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago a Sunderland collier was anchored
outside the Humber waiting for his pilot, and incidentally
chafing at the delay.</p>

<p>Eventually the pilot was shipped and the safe channel
entered for Hull, when the captain rather sarcastically
remarked: “Do you know where the mines
are?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the pilot, “I do not.”</p>

<p>“What! you’ve taken over my ship and you don’t
know? Well, I might just as well have brought the
ship in myself.”</p>

<p>The pilot smiled indulgently upon the enraged skipper
and said: “Aye, captain, ’tis true I don’t know
where the mines are, but I know where they are not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>


<h3>IT WORKED ALL RIGHT</h3>

<p>All the work was mapped out for the new charwoman,
but about the appointed time she arrived in
tears.</p>

<p>“My poor ’usband was shot in the battle,” she said,
“and ’e’s passed away.”</p>

<p>The employer was all sympathy, gave the widow
the half-crown she ought to have earned, and did the
necessary work herself.</p>

<p>The next day she met the neighbor who recommended
the woman, and said:</p>

<p>“You’ve heard, I suppose, about Mrs. W.’s husband
being killed?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her friend. “But she ought to have
got over it by now. It was in the Boer war.”</p>


<h3>GERMAN GIRLS CAN KNIT</h3>

<p>A certain Landwehrman had received his hundredth
pair of warm woolen stockings knit by fair hands.</p>

<p>“Fritz must be a regular Don Juan,” said one of his
less fortunate comrades.</p>

<p>“No,” said another, a fellow-townsman of the accused.
“No, it isn’t that. The fact is, Fritz, before
the war came, was teacher in a girls’ school.”</p>


<h3>BLOCKHEAD, EH?</h3>

<p>Sergeant—“Now, then, don’t you know how to hold
a rifle?”</p>

<p>Recruit—“I’ve run a splinter in me finger.”</p>

<p>Sergeant (exasperated)—“Oh, you ’ave, ’ave you?
Bin scratchin’ yer ’ead, I suppose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h3>HIS SOLE REASON</h3>

<p>As the sergeant was bawling out his orders and
watching the line of feet as the raw recruits endeavored
to obey the word of command, he found to his
astonishment that one pair of feet—more noticeable
on account of their extra large size—never turned.</p>

<p>Without taking his eyes off these feet the sergeant
bawled out, “About turn!”</p>

<p>He could see that all the feet except those he
watched turned in obedience. Rushing up to the
owner, a little fellow, he seized him by the shoulder,
shouting:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you turn with the rest?”</p>

<p>“Why, I did,” replied the trembling recruit.</p>

<p>“You did, eh? Well, I watched your feet, and
they never moved.”</p>

<p>“It’s the boots they gave me, sir,” said the poor
fellow. “They’re so large that when I turn my feet
turns in them.”</p>


<h3>IGNORANCE IS BLISS</h3>

<p>The two servants met in the tram.</p>

<p>“Does this war they’re talking so much about make
much difference to you?”</p>

<p>“The missus says we’ve got to economize, so we’ve
to have margarine at meals in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t she have it, then?”</p>

<p>“Not her. She says it doesn’t suit her digestion.
But there’s nothing wrong with her digestion. We
know that. For as often as not we send her up the
margarine and have the butter ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>


<h3>STROKE OF LUCK</h3>

<p>A story is current that a certain colonel of a British
regiment offered to give a sovereign for every German
killed by any of his men.</p>

<p>It happened shortly after this that a sergeant and
a private were out spying around, and took different
points for observation.</p>

<p>After a while the private crawled up to the sergeant
with a look of suppressed excitement on his face, and
in a tense whisper said:</p>

<p>“Here’s a fine piece of luck for us, sergeant!
There’s four thousand Germans over yonder, and
there’s only you and me for ’em. Won’t we rake some
quids in now?”</p>


<h3>SPECIMEN WANTED</h3>

<p>Mr. Horace Wyndham has published a book on
his military experiences, in which he quotes the reply
of an Egyptian clerk to a demand for 1,000 rations
for a Middlesex Regiment.</p>

<p>“Honorable Sir—Estimable telegram to hand, but
not understood. Male sex I know well; ditto female
sex. Middlesex, however, not familiar. Please send
specimen.”</p>


<h3>A LONE EXCEPTION</h3>

<p>He was a new recruit home on leave.</p>

<p>“Halloa,” said a friend, “how are you going on?
Applied for a commission yet?”</p>

<p>“Not me. All the rest in my battalion are sending
in their names, I think; but I say that a regiment
needs at least one regular, steady private.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>


<h3>CLEVER EXPEDIENT</h3>

<p>During a sham fight which constituted part of a
certain infantry battalion’s training for the war a
company was told off to follow up the retreating
“enemy.” For this purpose the pursuers, who had
been having a strenuous time, had to cross a fairly
wide river, and were marched to the nearest bridge,
which was about four miles away. Imagine their disappointment
on arriving to find this notice attached
to the bridge by the “enemy:”</p>

<p>“This bridge is blown up.”</p>

<p>But the officer in command of the pursuers was a
man of action, and promptly attached another notice
to one of his leading men and proceeded to march
them across the bridge. They had almost crossed
it, when an umpire suddenly appeared, frantically
waving his hands and exclaiming:</p>

<p>“This bridge is blown up; all these men are
drowned!”</p>

<p>The commanding officer made no reply, but simply
pointed to his notice, which read:</p>

<p>“This company is swimming across!”</p>


<h3>WHICH WOULD YOU PATRONIZE?</h3>

<p>It was Saturday night, and the rival butchers were
shouting against each other.</p>

<p>“’Ere’s a piece of beef,” shouted one, “any price
yer like. No war prices here.”</p>

<p>The other was equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>“Come ’ere,” he shouted. “Don’t ’ave piece at any
price; have piece with honor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>


<h3>SARCASTIC OLD VET.</h3>

<p>A man in the Veteran Reserves was called up
recently.</p>

<p>After a week at his new quarters he was brought
up before the officer commanding for not cleaning his
rifle one day. Said the officer commanding:—</p>

<p>“Hem, you’re an old soldier re-enlisted, I see. I
suppose it will be many years ago since you were
reprimanded? What was your last offence? Can
you remember what it was?”</p>

<p>Old Soldier (with irony on account of the repeated
assertions to his age): “For not cleanin’ me bow an’
arrow, sir!”</p>


<h3>BROTHERLY REPARTEE</h3>

<p>A cricket match was taking place near a German
internment camp. Many were the comments on the
game.</p>

<p>One of the British soldiers who had taken part in
the game turned to a German officer, and asked what
he thought of the game and the British cricketers.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said, “they’re very good, but we Germans
can beat you on the battlefield.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose you get the most ‘runs’ there!”
said the soldier.</p>


<h3>MADE IN GERMANY</h3>

<p>Chaplain (in French town near the Front)—“I
have been working so hard of late that I feel rather
run down. I must try a tonic.”</p>

<p>Soldier—“Why not try a glass of lager?”</p>

<p>Chaplain (badly shocked)—“Oh, that’s Teutonic!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>


<h3>WOLSELEY’S WAY</h3>

<p>One of the neatest stories of how a military officer
can do the right thing without sacrifice of dignity is
related of the man who afterwards became Commander-in-Chief
of the British Army. He was sitting in
a high-toned tap-room of Dublin, where privates were
not permitted the privilege of the bar. Two finely-built
men of a dragoon regiment, wearing long-service
stripes, entered and called for drinks, which were
curtly refused them. They turned without a word
and were retiring in good order.</p>

<p>“Halt!” came sharply from the officer in civilian’s
clothes. From sheer force of habit the soldiers obeyed
and faced about.</p>

<p>“I can purchase what I want here, I suppose?” said
the officer as he advanced to the bar.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then serve these two gentlemen with what they
want,” and there was a pleasant emphasis on the title.
“Gentlemen, will you drink with me?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, sir,” and the happy compact was
carried out. Then the dragoons courteously inquired
the name of the gentleman who had thrown out the
life-line, as it were.</p>

<p>“My name is Wolseley—Colonel Wolseley,” with
a smile.</p>

<p>Two pairs of heels went together with a click, two
brawny arms went up in salute, and the soldiers departed
amid the applause of all who had witnessed
the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<h3>IGNORED HIMSELF</h3>

<p>During camp parade of the buglers the other day
an Irish corporal was in charge. He was asked by
the C. O. if all the buglers were present, when he replied:</p>

<p>“No, sorr; one man absent.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said the C. O.; “go and find him, and
ask what he has to say for himself.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Pat came running back, and
shouted:</p>

<p>“Shure, sorr, and weren’t we a pair of duffers not
to know it? It wor meself. Bedad, sorr, Oi forgot
to call me own name, entoirely, sorr!”</p>


<h3>ANOTHER ANXIETY</h3>

<p>“I have some astonishing news for you, Maria,”
said Brown. “In addition to the war, England is
on the eve of a great strike, in which thousands upon
thousands of hands will be involved.”</p>

<p>“What a dreadful thing!” ejaculated his unsuspecting
victim. “When is it to take place?”</p>

<p>“This very night, my dear,” answered Brown,
gravely. “At midnight thousands of clock hands will
point to the hour, and it will strike twelve.”</p>


<h3>ONE QUALIFICATION</h3>

<p>Visitor (leaving inn, after sleepless night): “I
suppose you don’t happen to be a German?”</p>

<p>Landlord: “Do I look like it?”</p>

<p>Visitor: “No; but I thought I’d just ask, because
my room last night had a concrete bed in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>


<h3>GREAT DEEDS I HAVE DONE IN THE
GREAT WAR<br />

Supposed to Be Written by an Old British Soldier<br />
After the Style of Baron Munchausen</h3>

<p>I venture to set down some of my deeds in the
great war, both as a proof of my courage and veracity,
and in order to demonstrate the value of resourcefulness
in the conduct of military adventures.</p>

<p>Our company—I being then a private—disembarked
at ——, in France, and were at once sent to
the front. I was immediately selected to go out for
the purpose of obtaining information of the enemy’s
movements, and I set out determined to perform that
task at all costs. Unfortunately a Taube aeroplane
scouting overhead espied me, despite my disguise—a
small hayrick on my hat—and dropped a bomb, which,
though failing to strike me, burst near with such force
that it blew me into the air about twenty feet high,
and the Taube swooping down, its pilot caught me
by the breeches with a hook suspended on a rope. I
hung beneath that aeroplane for three days, with a
most exhausting backache, and it was not till the
night of the third day that I succeeded in climbing
up the rope and killing the pilot; but then, the petrol
being all consumed, I was obliged to land in the German
lines. There I was captured, and forced to remain
in the firing-line. This, however, proved to be
my good fortune, for, determined to perform my
task, I had recourse to a most extraordinary ruse to
escape. As soon as I was unobserved, I twined myself
about a big shell, and was put into the gun at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the next loading. The shot was a good one, and,
rendered invisible by the dense smoke, I rode on the
shell across the German and British lines, and landed
safely at the feet of my general, whom I was able
to supply with valuable information. For this deed
I was awarded the D. S. O. (Distinguished Suspension
Order).</p>

<p>The following day we were ordered to march to
——-, and hold it against the expected attack of
the Germans. The village was fifty miles away, and
we had but twelve hours for the journey. The pace
proved too much for my brave comrades, and one
after another they dropped out, till none was left
save myself and the captain, whom I carried the last
ten miles on my back, together with the rifles and
ammunition of twelve of my comrades. Reaching the
village, we requisitioned two houses, one at each end.
In one I took my stand with six rifles, in the other
the captain did likewise. Within an hour the Germans
attacked both positions in overwhelming force.
After two hours’ violent fighting those on my side
drew off to re-form, and I immediately raced across
to the captain’s house, just in time to repel a desperate
charge. Then I returned to the encounter on
my side, and these movements I repeated five times
during the night, till at dawn the rest of the company
came to our assistance. I had thirty-five bullet
wounds, but none of them being in a vital part, I desired
the doctors to remove the bullets at once, so
that I might continue my duties. My great feet on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
this occasion gained me the Order of the B.O.O.T.
(Best of Our Transports).</p>

<p>But on one more occasion I was able to serve my
country in an exceptional manner. Our wireless operator,
ordered to signal “Advance to Nancy,” his
mind being filled with another name, sent “Advance
to Lil,” to the French general. Discovering his mistake,
he was unable to correct it, for a shell shattered
his instrument. Quick as thought I flung off my coat
and ran like the wind to the French headquarters,
five miles away, arriving exactly one and a half seconds
before the message, just in time to take off my
hat and hold it in the way of the oncoming message,
which hit it with such force as to knock me backwards.
Thus I saved a ghastly mistake. At the conclusion
of war I was for this exploit made a corporal, and
decorated with the Order K. C. B. (Karnarftellem
Cops the Bun).</p>


<h3>WASTED SYMPATHY</h3>

<p>Whilst making some purchases in a village shop in
Scotland the other day, an excited inhabitant rushed
in with the news:—</p>

<p>“Tam Henry’s gaun awa’ wi’ the sodgers!”</p>

<p>The shopkeeper remarked dolefully:—</p>

<p>“My, the auld wife’ll miss him sairly.”</p>

<p>When the visitor had left to carry her news elsewhere,
a customer inquired sympathetically if “Tam
Henry” was the old woman’s only son.</p>

<p>“Naw, naw,” the shopkeeper answered with a pitying
smile, “Tam Henry’s her best hoarse!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<h3>KNEW HIM OF OLD</h3>

<p>A certain recruiting sergeant was sent by the military
authorities to his native town, with a view to getting
as many of his acquaintances to enlist as possible.</p>

<p>One morning, as he was walking down the street,
he saw a group of his old pals standing at the corner.</p>

<p>Going up to the group, he said, “Now, lads, what
do you say about joining the colors? You know, I
didn’t get these stripes for standing at street corners.”</p>

<p>“Nowe,” replied one of his pals, “if they’d gi’n
stripes for that tha’d ’a’ bin a bloomin’ zebra bi
neaw.”</p>


<h3>THIS ORIGINATED IN NEW YORK</h3>

<p>In one of the French restaurants in Soho, where
there had been a fight a few nights before, the following
was at once posted in large type:—</p>

<p>“The war will be settled abroad. Please do not
start anything here.”</p>

<p>An enterprising man has printed these placards in
large quantities, and is selling them to the restaurants
frequented by persons of various nationalities now
at war abroad.</p>


<h3>TWO POINTS OF VIEW</h3>

<p>The Family Man—“The cost of everything is increasing
at a terrible rate.”</p>

<p>The Military Expert—“Not everything. According
to statistics in former wars it cost fifteen thousand
dollars to kill a man, but now, with improved ordnance
and ammunition, it can be done for one-third of that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<h3>SOME KIND OF A MARSHAL</h3>

<p>Wife (proud of her military brother-in-law, to husband)—“Do
you know Fred has been recently promoted
to field-marshal?”</p>

<p>Husband—“To field-marshal! Impossible, dear.”</p>

<p>Wife (indignantly)—“Well, if it’s not a field-marshal
he’s come to, it’s a court-martial.”</p>


<h3>NOR ON THE SOCKS</h3>

<p>An English colonel, at kit inspection, said to Private
Flanigan:</p>

<p>“Ha! Yes, shirts, socks, flannels, all very good.
Now, can you assure me that all the articles of your
kit have buttons on them?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Private Flanigan, hesitating.</p>

<p>“How’s that, sir?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t no buttons on the towels, sir!”</p>


<h3>LESS WAR NEWS WANTED</h3>

<p>A well-known London journalist never uses a notebook,
but jots down such events as appeal to him, with
suggestions for his subsequent articles, on his cuffs.
At first his laundress was much puzzled by these hieroglyphics,
but as time went on she became able to read
them, and apparently derived much benefit and pleasure
therefrom.</p>

<p>One day the journalist received, with his laundered
garments, a slip of paper on which was written:—</p>

<p>“Your last washing was very interesting, but we
should be glad if you would give us more about ‘Scandals
in high life,’ and less about the war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h3>TWENTY STRAIGHT</h3>

<p>Sergeant (disgustedly, to Private Jones, who is
not exactly an expert at shooting)—“Ugh! don’t
waste your last bullet. Nineteen are quite enough to
blaze away without hitting the target once. Go behind
that wall and blow your brains out.”</p>

<p>Jones walked quietly away, and a few seconds later
a shot rang out.</p>

<p>“Great sausages, the fool’s done what I told him!”
howled the sergeant, running behind the wall. Great
was his relief when he saw Private Jones coming towards
him.</p>

<p>“Sorry, sergeant,” he said, apologetically; “another
miss.”</p>


<h3>RUSSIAN EXPECTATIONS</h3>

<p>A retort that shows something of the attitude of
Russian and Austrian officers before hostilities actually
broke out is reported by a Petrograd correspondent.</p>

<p>In the course of his last interview with the Russian
military authorities before the war, Prince Hohenlohe,
the Austrian military attaché, expressed surprise
that the Russians should be requisitioning so many
automobiles, the extensive use of which since then
may help to explain the rapid alternations of fortune
of engagements that have so often proved confusing.</p>

<p>“Your roads are too bad,” the Austrian remarked.
“Of what use are automobiles?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” replied the Russian, “but you must remember
that your Austrian roads are very good!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<h3>FREAKS OF BULLETS<br />

Wonderful Escapes From Death</h3>

<p>A sapper in the Royal Engineers tells the story
of an extraordinary escape which one of his comrades
experienced. A bullet took his cap off and cut a
groove through his hair, without injuring the scalp,
in such a manner that it looked as though he had
carefully parted his hair down the center.</p>

<p>This is but another illustration of the tricks that
bullets play at times. It is doubtful, however, if any
soldier in the present campaign has had such marvelous
escapes as Lieutenant A. C. Johnston, the
Hants County cricketer, who relates how, shortly before
he was slightly wounded, a shell hit the wall six
inches above his head, while shortly afterwards a bullet
hit the ground half a yard in front of him, bounded
up, and hit him on the body, bruising his ribs. Then
a bullet hit him over the heart, but was spent before
reaching him, and when in the hospital he picked it
out of his left-hand breast-pocket and sent it home
to his wife.</p>

<p>A charmed life, too, seems to be borne by a private
of the Manchester Regiment, who relates how, while
smoking a cigarette in the trenches, a bullet took
the “fag” out of his mouth, while another cut the
crown off his hat, leaving the peak still sticking on
his head. And it is characteristic of the humor of
“Tommy,” even when the fire is hottest, that when a
bullet took off the top of a tin of bully beef which
another private had in his hand, he looked at it, coolly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
turned round, made a bow in the direction of the enemy,
and thanked them for saving him the trouble
of finding a can-opener.</p>

<p>A curious escape from what might have been a
mortal wound was that of a Royal Scots Fusilier.
During a severe fight he suddenly felt the shock of a
bullet. “I am hit,” he said to his chum. Looking
down, however, he saw that the bullet had struck
a clip of cartridges in his top left-hand pouch, but
had done no other damage. The first cartridge must
have been a little loose, and as it twisted round when
it was struck, the bullet was turned off instead of
going straight through the soldier’s body, as it would
have done had all the cartridges been firm.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank Scudamore relates an extraordinary incident
which occurred during the Soudan campaign,
when he saw an officer, a friend of his, go down apparently
shot through the head. “To my surprise,”
he says, “I met him walking about after the battle,
apparently none the worse, save that his head was
bandaged. Then he showed me how the bullet, striking
and deflected by one of the hooks of his helmet
chain, had run right round his forehead, cutting a
groove under the skin, and had then glanced off the
helmet hook at the other side.”</p>


<h3>FINDING AN EXCUSE</h3>

<p>Private Atkins—“Jones just stood me a drink.”</p>

<p>His Best Girl—“And did you stand him one back?”</p>

<p>Private Atkins—“No; a true British soldier never
re-treats.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<h3>ONLY A MATTER OF TIME</h3>

<p>The general was busily inspecting a regiment the
colonel of which was a very bad horseman, and this
was well known to his men. The battalion was formed
up in quarter column, and as the commanding officer
gave the order “Advance in column,” the band struck
up the regimental march past, with the result that
his horse plunged and kicked furiously, and he was
very nearly unseated.</p>

<p>As the leading company was nearing the saluting-base
the captain glanced round to see if his men were
marching well, and was horrified to see the whole of
the front two ranks bunched up in the middle and
every man watching the commanding officer’s efforts
to retain his seat.</p>

<p>“Ease off, there!” he shouted, angrily.</p>

<p>“No ’ee ain’t,” said a young recruit, “but ’ee soon
will be!”</p>


<h3>SOUNDS LOGICAL</h3>

<p>Pat, who had joined the new army, was given his
uniform by the quartermaster. Everything fitted all
right till he came to put on the trousers, which he
said were far too tight.</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the quartermaster; “they’re fine.”</p>

<p>“I tell you they are too tight,” said Pat. “They
are tighter than me skin.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Pat; how can they be tighter than your
skin?”</p>

<p>“Begorra!” exclaimed Pat. “I can sit down in
my skin, but I can’t sit down in the trousers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>


<h3>UNWILLING MARTYR</h3>

<p>Some time ago little Willie rambled into the house,
threw his soldier suit in the corner, and began looking
over a book. This was unusual for the youngster,
and mother began to investigate.</p>

<p>“What did you come into the house for, Willie?”
she asked. “You haven’t quarrelled with Georgie
Brown, have you?”</p>

<p>“No, mother,” answered Willie; “but I’m not going
to play war with him any more.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” queried mother. “What has he been
doing?”</p>

<p>“It’s just this way,” explained Willie. “When
we play war I’m Germany and he’s England, and if
I don’t let him lick me every time he says that I’m
not patriotic.”</p>


<h3>THE TAR AND THE TARTAR</h3>

<p>Pat has always been celebrated the world over for
his repartee, and he did not belie his reputation for
smart retorts quite recently.</p>

<p>It happened that a warship touched at a military
port on the coast of Ireland, and a “Tommy,” meeting
a full-bearded Irish “tar” in the street, accosted
him with:—</p>

<p>“Here, I say, Pat, when are you goin’ to put those
whiskers of yours on the reserve list?”</p>

<p>Pat turned and eyed his questioner thoughtfully
for the space of half a second, then:—</p>

<p>“Begorra, just as soon as ever you place your
tongue on the civil list,” was his reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>


<h3>DON’T SAY “ROVER”</h3>

<p>The inhabitants of a Sussex village recently received
somewhat short notice of the visit of a regiment
of soldiers, and local butchers’ shops were absolutely
cleared out in the endeavor to treat the visitors
well at their various one-night billets.</p>

<p>One motherly old dear, who was cute enough to
foresee the possible shortage, was early on the market
and managed to secure a nice piece of steak weighing
two-and-a-half pounds.</p>

<p>Her three men arrived, very tired and very hungry,
and by the time their ablutions were through the meat
was done to a turn.</p>

<p>“There,” she said, proudly, as she placed it on
the table, “I thought you’d like somethin’ substantial.
If you manage to eat that you won’t be wanting
much more till the morning. You’re lucky to get
it, I can tell you, for there isn’t another scrap o’
meat to be had in the place for love or money. Just
shout out if you’re wantin’ any more tea made.”</p>

<p>The soldiers decided to have a joke with the old
lady. They transferred the steak to a spare plate,
popped it under the table, and called for her attendance.</p>

<p>“Are the other two steaks ready yet?” came the
question.</p>

<p>The old lady eyed the empty dish and held up her
hands in astonishment. “Other two!” she exclaimed.
“Why, I thought that one was enough for the three
of you. Well, well, I’m done altogether. I can’t beg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
borrow, or steal a bit, and I’m right down sorry for
you, that I am.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, mother,” laughed the soldiers. “It’s
too bad of us—we were only having a joke. The
steak’s under the table.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” screamed the lady. “So is
Rover!”</p>

<p>Instantly the men dived underneath the table to
secure their meat. They saw a big black retriever
dog, looking on very good terms with himself, beside
an empty dish. The steak was gone.</p>

<p>And three very tired and very hungry men made a
meal off bread and cheese. It is dangerous to say
“Rover” in their hearing nowadays.</p>


<h3>SCARS OF BATTLE</h3>

<p>“Yes, John received his trunk this morning. It’s
been somewhere over there in Germany for eleven
weeks.”</p>

<p>“Where is John?”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s out in the garage shooting bullets
through the trunk. He thinks they’ll make it look
so much more interesting, don’t you know.”</p>


<h3>SUITED TO HIS POSITION</h3>

<p>The Irish adjutant’s wife was telling Bridget about
her husband.</p>

<p>“My husband, Bridget,” she said, proudly, “is at
the head of the Tipperary militia.”</p>

<p>“Oi t’ought as much, ma’am,” said Bridget, cheerfully.
“Ain’t he got th’ foine malicious look?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>


<h3>KAISER WILHELM II</h3>

<p>“I don’t know that there is much use in keeping
my school open more than a month or two each year,”
said the German pedagogue.</p>

<p>“Why is that?”</p>

<p>“Our Emperor has simplified matters to such an
extent that when you ask the name of the world’s
greatest poet, painter, musician, general, traveller, or
monarch, there is only one answer to all the questions.”</p>


<h3>AS SEEN IN FRANCE</h3>

<p>Two French soldiers took their places in the
trenches—the one middle-aged, who had long since
received his baptism of fire, the other a mere youth,
whose chattering teeth and blanched face proved it
was his first experience of real war.</p>

<p>The older soldier tried to reassure his frightened
companion. “Be brave, my lad; remember you fight
for France.”</p>

<p>A shell screeched through the air close overhead,
and the young man’s terror increased.</p>

<p>More soothing words, but more shells, and the upset
nerves still on edge. An hour passed, punctuated
by many kindly encouragements, but the new soldier’s
fear had not abated.</p>

<p>The patience of the other was at last exhausted.</p>

<p>“Why do you shiver and shake like that, you vain
young fool?” said he. “You don’t suppose the Germans
are firing all these expensive shells at you, do
you? You are not a cathedral or a work of art!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<h3>ANYTHING TO QUALIFY</h3>

<p>A lot of old-timers of the Army and Navy Club in
Piccadilly were swapping stories.</p>

<p>“One Sam Haskins,” says a retired brigadier-general,
“decided to enlist. He burned with a desire to
serve his country. So he applied at a recruiting office,
and was duly punched and prodded, trotted up
and down, jumped over chairs and tables, and so forth.</p>

<p>“Then came the questions. All manner of them
were fired at him, and he answered most of them
satisfactorily. Then came the stern inquiry:</p>

<p>“‘Have you ever served a term of imprisonment?’</p>

<p>“‘No, sir,’ stammered Sam; ‘but,’ he added, hastily,
‘I’d be willing to serve a short one, if it’s necessary.’”</p>


<h3>TAKING THE JOY OUT OF LIFE</h3>

<p>Wife—“The heavy explosions of a battle always
cause rain. It rained after Waterloo. It rained after
Fontenoy. It rained after Marathon.”</p>

<p>Husband—“But Marathon was fought with spears
and arrows, my dear.”</p>

<p>Wife—“There you go again! Always throwing
cold water on everything I have to say.”</p>


<h3>ON HIS WAY</h3>

<p>Still another recruiting story. A new cavalry
trooper was being initiated into the mysteries of riding
when his horse bolted. “Where the deuce are
you going?” thundered the instructor. The reply
came back in gasps: “Don’t know—but the ’orse’s
’ome is at ’Ammersmith.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>


<h3>MORTIFIED THE FRENCHMAN</h3>

<p>“Of course, doctor, German measles are seldom serious?”</p>

<p>“I never met but one fatal case.”</p>

<p>“Fatal!”</p>

<p>“Yes; it was a Frenchman, and when he discovered
it was German measles that he had, mortification
set in.”</p>


<h3>CHECKS FOR TWO</h3>

<p>When the young officer, ordered to the Front,
called on his tailor to get a fresh outfit, the tailor
could not forget that there was already an old and
unsettled account.</p>

<p>But he felt nervous about broaching the subject.</p>

<p>“I see the Germans,” said the young officer, casually,
“have had a check.”</p>

<p>“Lucky Germans!” said the tailor, wistfully.</p>

<p>The young man looked puzzled for a moment, and
then took the gentle hint. Next day the bill was
settled.</p>


<h3>SYMPATHETIC SOUL</h3>

<p>Scene—Soldiers’ concert at which no alcoholic
liquors are being supplied, the men being served with
mineral waters by young lady helpers.</p>

<p>Soldier (to young lady helper)—“Do you see that
the man who is singing has got his eyes half-shut?”</p>

<p>Young Lady—“So he has. What’s he doing that
for?”</p>

<p>Soldier—“He can’t bear to look at us. He knows
wot we’re sufferin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>


<h3>A QUESTION OF DIET</h3>

<p>During a particularly nasty dust-storm at one of
the camps a recruit ventured to seek shelter in the
sacred precincts of the cook’s domain.</p>

<p>After a time he broke an awkward silence by saying
to the cook:</p>

<p>“If you put the lid on that camp kettle you would
not get so much of the dust in your soup.”</p>

<p>The irate cook glared at the intruder, and then
broke out:</p>

<p>“See here, me lad. Your business is to serve your
country.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted the recruit, “but not to eat it.”</p>


<h3>A GENTLE HINT</h3>

<p>The British soldier is never at a loss when sarcasm
is needed, and an example of his readiness was seen
only the other day.</p>

<p>A long route march had been in progress and the
officer had been none too patient. Several times he
had had occasion to speak strongly to the men. At
last, on the march home, the order came, “March easy”—the
time when songs are indulged in. There was no
call for “Tipperary” this time, but unanimously they
started singing, “Kind Words Can Never Die.”</p>


<h3>A MATTER OF PUNCTUATION</h3>

<p>Bix—“I see there’s a report from Holland that concrete
bases for German cannon have been found there.”</p>

<p>Dix—“Don’t believe a word you hear from Holland.
The geography says it is a low, lying country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>


<h3>AND THERE ARE OTHERS</h3>

<p>First Lady—“I see the master cutting a dash this
morning. Nobody would think he was hard-up.”</p>

<p>Second Lady—“Lor’ bless yer, no! Since this ’ere
Merrytorium come in he walks down the High Street
in front of all the shops as though he didn’t owe ’em
a penny.”</p>


<h3>SOME BONEHEAD</h3>

<p>The value of army remounts was exemplified the
other day by the cavalry sergeant who lost patience
with an awkward recruit.</p>

<p>“Never approach the horses from behind without
speaking,” he exclaimed. “If you do they’ll kick
you in that thick head of yours, and the end of it
will be that we shall have nothing but lame horses
in the squadron.”</p>


<h3>PROUD OF IT</h3>

<p>A train loaded with wounded soldiers drew up at
a certain station. Among these was one whose face
could not be discerned for bandages.</p>

<p>“You poor, poor boy,” sympathized an English
lady, who approached him timidly.</p>

<p>“Madam,” replied the soldier, with as much pride
as springing to attention would convey, “don’t pity
me. Pity my chums in the train there, who got hit
where it won’t show.”</p>

<p>“Why, why,” she stammered. “I thought you
would not like to be disfigured.”</p>

<p>“Disfigured!” the soldier replied, scornfully; “I
am not disfigured, I am decorated!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>


<h3>DIPLOMACY</h3>

<p>A well-known English politician was much annoyed
by reporters. One day he was enjoying a chat at a
London hotel, when a strange young man came up
who seemed to have something of importance to communicate,
and led him across the room. Arrived in a
corner, the stranger whispered, “I am on the staff of
an evening paper, and I should like you to tell me
what you think of the Government’s foreign policy.”
Mr. Dash looked a little puzzled; then he said, “Follow
me.” Leading the way, he walked through the
reading-room, down some steps into the drawing-room,
through a long passage into the dining-room,
and drawing his visitor into the corner behind the
hat-rack, he whispered, “I really don’t know anything
about it.”</p>


<h3>AN OVER-DOSE</h3>

<p>A well-known physician was examining a class of
nurses. He described the condition of a patient, and
asked one nurse how much morphine, in her opinion,
should be administered to the sufferer.</p>

<p>“Eight grains,” promptly replied the nurse.</p>

<p>The doctor made no comment, and the girl passed
on. When her turn came again she appeared greatly
confused, and said to the examiner, “Doctor, I wish
to correct the answer I made last time. I meant to
say that one-eighth of a grain should be given to the
patient.”</p>

<p>“Too late,” remarked the physician, without looking
up from his question paper. “The man’s dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<h3>NOBODY CONCERNED</h3>

<p>The wounded soldier was being attended by the
doctor. The latter seemed to treat the case in a light-hearted
manner. He prodded the soldier in the ribs,
and grinned.</p>

<p>“You’ll be all right,” he said. “You’ve got a bullet
in your left arm; but that does not trouble me
in the least.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it does,” said the soldier. “An’
if you’d got a bullet in both arms I don’t suppose
it ’ud trouble me, either.”</p>


<h3>HARD LUCK</h3>

<p>He was a Canadian and he wore a corporal’s stripes.
There he sat snugly in a sheltered part of his trench
in that little corner of Belgium and played poker
with a quartet of his comrades. Luck was against
him. He had lost about everything he had to lose,
when at the very height of the game—just after the
dealer had done his best and worst—a shell came
through the roof of the shelter, passed between the
Canadian’s long, lean legs (luckily without hitting
him), and buried itself harmlessly in the soft earth.
The others of the party leaped up in not inexcusable
haste and fled from the place, but the Canadian did
not move.</p>

<p>The disturbance brought the company commander
on the run.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” says he.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” says the Canadian, “that there shell
drops in on us and when it don’t explode at once I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
judge it is pretty safe not to go off at all. So I
just set where I am. The cursed luck of it is that I’ve
been playin’ away here all morning’ drawin’ rotten
cards and losin’ my shirt, and here just as I holds
the first four of a kind that’s gladdened my two eyes
since Hector was a pup—and kings at that, sir—at
that identical moment there comes this pifflin’ German
turnip and the other fellows beats it.”</p>


<h3>HOW HE TOOK HIS</h3>

<p>English men-of-war have no ice-making machines
on board, as do our ships, and everybody knows how
the English fail to understand us on the subject of
the use of ice, especially in our drinks.</p>

<p>An English officer was aboard one of our ships of
the Asiatic fleet, and, on being served with an iced
drink, commented on the delights of having cool water
aboard. The American officer responded with an offer
of a small cake of ice, which was sent the following
morning. Meeting the Englishman ashore a week
later, the American asked him if he had enjoyed the
ice.</p>

<p>“Enjoy it, old top? Why, do you know, that was
the first cold bawth I’ve had since I left England!”</p>


<h3>WILLING TO OBLIGE</h3>

<p>A recruit very anxious to join Kitchener’s Army
enters recruiting station determined to accommodate
himself to any condition required.</p>

<p>Officer (filling in form)—“What’s your religion?”</p>

<p>Zealous Recruit—“Well, what are you short of?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<h3>CAUSE FOR PREJUDICE</h3>

<p>“Why are you for the Allies?” a friend asked a
solemn-looking neutral, who looked as if there had
been much suffering in his life. “Is it because you
abhor Prussian militarism?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Is it that you fear Germany’s desire to expand, to
absorb foreign lands? Is it that you dislike the German
character?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the solemn-looking individual.</p>

<p>“Well, why are you for the Allies?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said the other, with a pensive air, “I
once ate some sauerkraut.”</p>


<h3>SELF-BETRAYED</h3>

<p>A sentry was giving close attention to his post in
the neighborhood of a British army camp in England,
challenging returning stragglers late after dark. The
following is reported as an incident of his vigil:</p>

<p>“Who goes there?” called the sentry at the sound
of approaching footsteps.</p>

<p>“Coldstream Guards!” was the response.</p>

<p>“Pass, Coldstream Guards!” rejoined the sentry.</p>

<p>“Who goes there?” again challenged the sentry.</p>

<p>“Forty-ninth Highlanders!” returned the unseen
pedestrian.</p>

<p>“Pass, Forty-ninth Highlanders!”</p>

<p>“Who goes there?” sounded a third challenge.</p>

<p>“None of your d——n business!” was the husky
reply.</p>

<p>“Pass, Canadians!” acquiesced the sentry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>


<h3>BRITISH HUMOR</h3>

<p>The crew of the Harpalion, one of the British ships
torpedoed off Beachy Head, arrived in London yesterday.
Mr. S. Harper, the second officer, describing
the experiences of the crew, said the ship was sailing
down the Channel at the rate of about eleven and a
half knots.</p>

<p>“We had just sat down to tea,” said Mr. Harper,
“at the engineers’ table, and the chief engineer was
saying grace. He had just uttered the words, ‘For
what we are about to receive may the Lord make us
truly thankful,’ when there came an awful crash.”</p>


<h3>A MIXED BLESSING</h3>

<p>A gallant Tommy, having received from England
an anonymous gift of socks, entered them at once,
for he was about to undertake a heavy march. He
was soon prey to the most excruciating agony, and
when, a mere cripple, he drew off his foot-gear at the
end of a terrible day, he discovered inside the toe of
the sock what had once been a piece of stiff writing
paper, now reduced to pulp, and on it appeared in
bold, feminine hand the almost illegible benediction:
“God bless the wearer of this pair of socks!”</p>


<h3>OR A BASEBALL UMPIRE</h3>

<p>“I saw a war picture, and one of the soldiers in the
firing-line, amid bursting shells and dead and wounded
men, was yawning.”</p>

<p>“He was probably a football-player to whom his
surroundings seemed tame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>


<h3>NOT TO EXCEED HIS LIMIT</h3>

<p>During the opening stages of the present war a
certain soldier was told that there were three Germans
to every one of the Allied forces in that part of the
field.</p>

<p>Tommy went into action with great vigor, but
later his company sergeant was horrified to see him
shoulder his rifle and calmly march to the rear.</p>

<p>“Where are you off to?” he roared.</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied Tommy, “I’ve killed three of the
enemy. I’ve done my share, so I’m off back to the
camp.”</p>


<h3>OUT OF HARM’S WAY</h3>

<p>“If you had to go to war what position would
you choose?”</p>

<p>“The drummer’s, I think.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“When a charge was ordered, I’d pick up my drum
and beat it.”</p>


<h3>SHOWING HIM HOW</h3>

<p>The company was about to commence practice in
trench-digging.</p>

<p>“Shall I show you how to handle the spade?” inquired
a young officer of one private who was curiously
watching the efforts of his companions.</p>

<p>“Aye, if tha likes,” responded the soldier.</p>

<p>“There you are,” commented the officer shortly afterwards,
as he handed over the spade.</p>

<p>“Tha shapes pratty weel,” said the private, a collier
from the Durham pits, “for a novice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<h3>NO EXCEPTION</h3>

<p>Policeman (arresting burglar)—“Ain’t people worried
enough by this war without burglaring their
houses?”</p>

<p>Burglar—“All the papers are saying ‘business as
usual.’”</p>


<h3>IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE</h3>

<p>Bill Bates, a coal miner, had joined Kitchener’s
Army, and was undergoing musketry instruction.</p>

<p>The officer had been at some pains to impress upon
the recruits that in loading a rifle they should place
one cartridge in the barrel and ten in the magazine.</p>

<p>Singling out Bill, the officer said to him:</p>

<p>“Now, what do you do with your cartridges when
loading?”</p>

<p>“Put one in t’ tunnel an’ ten in t’ can!” was the
reply.</p>


<h3>SCARED HIM TO THINK OF IT</h3>

<p>The general was distributing medals for special
valor. Summoning Private Bumptious to step forward,
much to the general surprise of the ranks, he
thundered out:</p>

<p>“Men, look upon this hero, and imitate his bravery!
All through the long night he stood firm at his sentinel’s
post, although completely surrounded by the
enemy, and there he remained, calmly.”</p>

<p>Private Bumptious turned deadly pale. But before
he fell in a faint to the ground, he gasped out:</p>

<p>“Then they were enemies! I thought they were
our own troops.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>


<h3>WHAT HAPPENED TO REIMS</h3>

<p>“Wasn’t it fearful about the Reims cathedral?”</p>

<p>“Don’t say Reems; it sounds horribly ignorant.”</p>

<p>“Well, how do you pronounce it?”</p>

<p>“Why, Hranss.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Hn—Hranhss! Just as if you were clearing your
throat. See? Hranss!”</p>

<p>“Well, you sound as if you had a dreadful influenza,
threatened with grip!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s right, anyhow. H—hn—hnh—hrahnhss!”</p>

<p>“You’d better go to Arizona! You’ll never get
well here! I don’t believe you, anyway. Everybody
says Reems.”</p>

<p>“They don’t, either!”</p>

<p>“They do so!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it depends on the sort of people you
associate with—”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t go with a lot of fake highbrows,
anxious to show off the French they learned in a
course of lessons by mail—”</p>

<p>“Better than a lot of country junks who don’t
know how to pronounce—”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, the church wasn’t hurt much, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“No, they say it can be repaired. How do you like
my hat?”</p>

<p>“Heavenly! What do you think of mine?”</p>

<p>“Adorable! Let’s go in and have soda.”</p>

<p>“Let’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>


<h3>REBUKE THAT DIDN’T WORK</h3>

<p>British Teacher (to small boy)—“So you’ve come
to school without a pen, eh? What would you say
if one of our soldiers went to France without his
gun?”</p>

<p>Tommy—“Please, sir, I should say he was an officer.”</p>


<h3>SOMETHING TO THINK OF</h3>

<p>The awkward squad had been having a lecture in
musketry. Just before they were dismissed the instructor
asked one of them:</p>

<p>“Why is the rifle placed in the hands of a soldier?”</p>

<p>“To protect my life,” came the prompt reply.</p>

<p>The instructor glared at him.</p>

<p>“Protect your life!” he snorted. “Who’s bothering
about your life? The rifle, my lad, is placed
in your hands for the destruction of the King’s enemies!”</p>


<h3>A FAVORABLE BALANCE</h3>

<p>A friend called on a merchant who did a large Continental
business to offer him his sympathy.</p>

<p>“This must hit you very hard.”</p>

<p>“Very hard,” said the merchant. “I’ve over eleven
hundred pounds owing to me in Germany, and it’s
touch and go whether I ever get a penny of it. Still,
we’ve got to put up with something for the country.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you take it so cheerfully.”</p>

<p>“Well,” explained the merchant, “I owe over sixteen
hundred pounds in Germany.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>


<h3>DISREGARDING THE LIMIT</h3>

<p>In order to stimulate rifle practice in a Lancashire
district, especially amongst the rising generation, a
match was arranged in which the competitors must be
over fourteen years and under seventeen years of age.</p>

<p>The match was in progress, and there seemed to
be not a few of the competitors who would never
see another seventeenth birthday.</p>

<p>The climax was reached, however, when a young
enthusiast, seeing the excellent score one of the competitors
was making, astonished the spectators by
shouting at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“Go on, father; get another bull’s-eye!”</p>


<h3>NO ABBREVIATIONS WANTED</h3>

<p>A corporal in the Liverpool Scottish tells a good
story of “the front.”</p>

<p>The sentry’s challenge is no longer the orthodox
“Halt! Who goes there?” It is a short, prosaic,
“Who are you?”</p>

<p>The other day a tired sentry challenged a party
of the Princess Patricia’s Own Canadian Light Infantry.
Back came the response, “P.P.O.C.L.I.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hear you say your alphabet,”
growled the sentry. “Who the blazes are you?”</p>


<h3>HIS SACRIFICE</h3>

<p>“George, where are your school-books!”</p>

<p>“When notices appeared that books were wanted
for the wounded, I gave mine to them.”—Humoristicke
Listy (Prague).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<h3>UNSATISFACTORY OFFICER</h3>

<p>They were about the rawest lot of recruits the
sergeant had ever tackled. He worked hard for a
couple of hours, and at last, thinking he had them
licked into shape, he decided to test them.</p>

<p>“Right turn!” he barked; then, before they had
ceased to move, barked again, “Left turn!”</p>

<p>One burly yokel slowly left the ranks and made off
towards the barracks.</p>

<p>“Here, you!” yelled the sergeant, angrily, “where
are you off to?”</p>

<p>“Ah’ve had enough on’t,” replied the recruit, in
disgusted tones. “Tha dissent knaw thee arn mind
two minutes stright running.”</p>


<h3>PERPETUAL MOTION</h3>

<p>“Excuse me, but do you mind keeping your dog
indoors at night till the war is over?”</p>

<p>“Why?” said the surprised dog-owner to the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Well, your dog’s barking sounds just like a ‘special’
boy shouting in the distance. My wife’s got
two brothers at the front, and every time she hears
your dog she sends me racing down to get the ‘special,’
and says I’ve been too stupid to catch the boy.”</p>


<h3>MURDERING HIM</h3>

<p>Very British Guest—“What! Brahms? You’re
surely not going to sing German?”</p>

<p>Hostess (apologetically)—“Well, of course, I shall
take care to sing it flat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<h3>SLACKER GETS BACK</h3>

<p>Frederick Palmer, the war correspondent, was talking
about England.</p>

<p>“Everything is war, war, war, over there,” he said.
“Dear help the young man who is not in khaki. He
has a dreadful time.</p>

<p>“Now and then, though, one of these slackers—as
they are called—gets a bit of his own back.</p>

<p>“A slacker, for example, was passing a prison
camp near London when an interned German shouted
at him from the barbed wire fence:</p>

<p>“‘Hey, Kitchener vants you!’</p>

<p>“The slacker frowned. ‘What?’ he said.</p>

<p>“‘Kitchener vants you,’ the German repeated.</p>

<p>“‘Well, by Jove,’ said the slacker, ‘he’s got you,
all right!’”</p>


<h3>NEW CAUSE FOR WAR</h3>

<p>Robert Skinner, ex-consul-general to London, said
at a dinner:</p>

<p>“Of course neutrals see things from one viewpoint
and belligerents from another. We all have our various
viewpoints.</p>

<p>“An English inebriate was recently released from
jail. To a friend who met him outside the prison gates
he said:</p>

<p>“‘Well, mate, wot noose?’</p>

<p>“‘There’s a law agin’ treatin’, was the reply, ‘and
pretty near the whole world is at war.’</p>

<p>“‘Just think,’ he said. ‘Just think of a no-treatin’
law havin’ sech an effect as that.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<h3>NO ROSE WITHOUT ITS THORN</h3>

<p>The wounded soldier had reached home and was
just out of a long delirium.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he said, feebly, as he felt the loving
hands making him comfortable. “Where am I?
In heaven?”</p>

<p>“No, dear,” cooed his devoted wife. “I am still
with you.”</p>


<h3>A GOOD COME-BACK, BILL</h3>

<p>A chaplain in the navy enjoys telling of his endeavors
to induce a marine to give up the use of tobacco.
During a talk that ensued between the two, the chaplain
said:—</p>

<p>“After all, Bill, you must reflect that in all creation
there is not to be found any animal except man
that smokes.”</p>

<p>The marine sniffed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed, “and you won’t find, either, any
other animal in all creation that cooks its food, or
wears clothes.”</p>


<h3>ON THE SAFE SIDE</h3>

<p>Zealous Sentry—“Afraid I can’t let you go by
without the password, sir.”</p>

<p>Irate Officer—“But, confound you! I tell you I
have forgotten it. You know me well enough. I’m
Major Jones.”</p>

<p>Sentry—“Can’t help it, sir; must have the password.”</p>

<p>Voice from the Guard-Tent—“Oh, don’t stand arguing
all night, Bill; shoot ’im.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>


<h3>COULDN’T BE DONE</h3>

<p>The English official had been telling the old Scottish
farmer what he must do in the case of a German
invasion on the East Coast of Scotland.</p>

<p>“An’ hiv I reely tae dae this wi’ a’ ma beesties gin
the Germans come?” asked the old fellow at the finish.</p>

<p>The official informed him that such was the law,
“All live stock of every description must be branded
and driven inland.”</p>

<p>“Dearie me!” gasped the farmer, in dismay. “I’m
thinking I’ll hae an awful; ob wi’ ma bees!”</p>


<h3>ON THE FIRING LINE</h3>

<p>A stranger became one of a group of listeners to
a veteran of many battles. The veteran had about
concluded a vividly colored narrative of a furious
battle, in which he had taken part.</p>

<p>“Just think of it,” exclaimed one of the party,
turning to the stranger. “How would you like to
stand with shells bursting all around you?”</p>

<p>“I have been there,” responded the newcomer.</p>

<p>“What? Have you, too, been a soldier?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the stranger. “I am an actor.”</p>


<h3>A MATTER OF TRADE</h3>

<p>Outside one of the recruiting depots in a large
town a sergeant saw a smart young milkman, and,
thinking to get a fresh recruit, said:</p>

<p>“Young man, would you like to serve the King?”</p>

<p>“Rather!” said the milkman, eagerly. “How many
quarts does he want?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>


<h3>NOT LIKELY</h3>

<p>Two Irishmen were walking into Dublin from one
of the outlying villages, and fell to discussing the war
and the consequent increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>“But have ye heard the latest news?” says Tim.</p>

<p>“No,” says Pat. “Phwat is it?”</p>

<p>“There’s a penny off the loaf.”</p>

<p>“Bedad,” says Phat, “I hope it’s off the penny
ones.”</p>


<h3>IMPORTANT POSTSCRIPT</h3>

<p>An Army officer’s wife wrote to a Royal Army
medical corps officer saying her child was suffering
during teething; she addressed the letter “Dr.
Brown.”</p>

<p>The recipient returned it with the remark that he
should be addressed “Brigade-Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel
Brown.”</p>

<p>Whereupon the lady wrote back:—</p>

<p>“Dear Brigade-Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel Brown—I
am sorry about mistake.—Yours, May Jones.</p>

<p>“P. S.-Please bring your sword to lance baby’s
gums.”</p>


<h3>OR A SCRAP OF PAPER</h3>

<p>“I suppose you had a good deal of trouble when
you spent your holiday in Germany this summer?”
said Mrs. De Jinks.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Von Slammerton; “chiefly in the
matter of getting money, however. Why, would you
believe it, Mrs. De Jinks, a letter of credit over there
wasn’t of any more value than a treaty of neutrality?”</p>

<h3>NOT TO BE OUTDONE</h3>

<p>An Irishman who had recently joined Lord Kitchener’s
Army was sitting in a railway refreshment room
the other day, when two smart young soldiers entered.
Thinking to make the Irishman look small, one of
them went up to the young lady attendant and asked
for “A good cigar for a Hussar!”</p>

<p>A little time afterwards the other one went up and
said: “A glass of beer for a Grenadier!”</p>

<p>Pat was not to be taken down so easily, and after
a few moments’ thought went up to the bar and, in
a loud voice, ordered “A good tea for a V. C.!”</p>


<h3>NEVER FAZED HIM</h3>

<p>At a recruiting meeting recently the speaker, having
got his audience in a high state of enthusiasm by
telling them of the many brave deeds of the British
soldiers in France, suddenly espied a big, strongly
built man at the back of the hall. “My man,” he cried,
“how is it that you are not at the front?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is all right,” replied the burly yokel; “I
can hear every word you say from here.”</p>


<h3>STAY-AT-HOME TOILET</h3>

<p>A South London resident, whose garden runs down
to the railway line, has hit upon a novel recruiting
advertisement.</p>

<p>He has hung out two old petticoats with a poster
reading:</p>

<p>“If you won’t help your King and Country now
you had better wear these.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<h3>WHY BE NEUTRAL?</h3>

<p>If you favor war, dig a trench in your back yard,
fill it half full of water, crawl into it, and stay there
for a day or two without anything to eat, get a lunatic
to shoot at you with a brace of revolvers and a
machine-gun, and you will have something just as
good, and you will save your country a great deal of
expense.</p>


<h3>BATHING IN TEARS</h3>

<p>“Some of the soldiers in those trenches,” said a
doctor, recently back for a rest, “don’t get a chance to
wash for weeks at a time. They eat like bears, they
never take cold, their health is superb—but, dear me,
how they look, with never a wash!</p>

<p>“A humorist of the Coldstream Guards was singing
in a second-line trench a parody of ‘Tipperary.’ It
was a funny parody, and in the midst of it a young
sergeant shouted to the singer:—</p>

<p>“Yer makin’ me laugh till I cry, Bill! Won’t
yer stop it? The tears are makin’ me face all
muddy.’”</p>


<h3>WHERE HE COULDN’T GO</h3>

<p>A few Sundays ago Bobby’s mother was hurrying
him to get ready for Sunday-school. Bobby (aged
seven), not being very fond of Sunday-school, was
grumbling all the time about schools in general and
Sunday-schools in particular. Finally, to give vent to
his feelings, he exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“I wish there was only one Sunday-school in the
world, and that—er—that one was in Germany.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<h3>PEACE SUGGESTION</h3>

<p>Ernest P. Bicknell, national director of the American
Red Cross, said on his return from Belgium to a
Washington reporter:</p>

<p>“If peace is to come, each side must do its share.
Advances must be made like the girl, you know.</p>

<p>“A young millionaire said to a beautiful girl on a
moonlit beach between two dances:</p>

<p>“‘Don’t you like that Shakespearean quotation:</p>

<p>“‘“The friends thou hast and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to they soul with hoops of steel”?’</p>

<p>“The girl sighed.</p>

<p>“‘Beautiful,’ she said. ‘Beautiful. But wouldn’t
hoops of gold be better?’”</p>


<h3>HEADING HIM OFF</h3>

<p>An absentee soldier at West London police court
complained that he had not been able to get a decent
dinner at the police station and that he was hungry.</p>

<p>“Well, I like to show consideration to men serving
their country,” said the magistrate. “Would you
like something now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could do with tea and bread and butter,”
the soldier answered.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the magistrate, but the soldier
amended his request.</p>

<p>“Can I have tea, bread and butter and cheese?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the magistrate, laughing, “but take
him away, jailer, before he asks for champagne and
oysters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<h3>CAPTURED, NOT STOLEN</h3>

<p>A British soldier in Belgium was one morning
wending his way to camp with a fine rooster in his
arms when he was stopped by his colonel to know if
he had been stealing chickens.</p>

<p>“No, colonel,” was the reply, “I saw the old fellow
sitting on the wall and I ordered him to crow
for England, and he wouldn’t, so I just took him
prisoner.”</p>


<h3>LANDED A LARGE ORDER</h3>

<p>A Herculean soldier, arriving at Liverpool by rail,
somewhat travel-stained, was passing along Lime
Street when he stopped and called on a street arab to
shine his boots. His feet were in proportion to his
height, and, looking at the tremendous boots before
him, the arab knelt down on the pavement and, hailing
a companion near by, exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“Billie, come o’er and gie’s a hand; I’ve got an
army contract.”</p>


<h3>WELCOME RELIEF</h3>

<p>A chap had just gone to Flanders from the training
camp in Devon, and his calmness and cheerfulness under
German fire impressed everyone. So much so, in
fact, that his corporal declared:</p>

<p>“I never saw a new hand settle right down to it like
George.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said another recruit, “if you knew George’s
wife, corporal, you’d understand how the poor fellow
enjoys a quiet day among the vitriol sprays and
poison bombs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE USUAL QUERY</h3>

<p>An English school inspector, who did not look beyond
military age, got a Roland for his Oliver the
other day. He invited a class he was examining to put
questions to him.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” he said, “don’t be shy; it’s your turn
now. Ask me any question you like on any subject
you like, and if I can, I’ll answer it.”</p>

<p>After hesitating, a small but courageous boy held
up his hand and blurted out: “Why are you not in
khaki?”</p>


<h3>BEST OF REASONS</h3>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t believe in war,” cried the little
man. “It means invasion and confiscation and a forcible
and brutal alteration of existing boundaries.”</p>

<p>The man across the way turned to his companion
and asked in a whisper who the little man was.</p>

<p>“He is a mapmaker,” the companion whisperingly
replied, “and he’s got an immense stock of old maps
on hand.”</p>


<h3>MOST UNUSUAL</h3>

<p>A British officer inspecting sentries guarding the
line in Flanders came across a raw-looking yoeman.</p>

<p>“What are you here for?” he asked.</p>

<p>“To report anything unusual, sir.”</p>

<p>“What would you call unusual?”</p>

<p>“I dunno exactly, sir.”</p>

<p>“What would you do if you saw five battleships
steaming across the field?”</p>

<p>“Sign the pledge, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>


<h3>MORE SURFACE TO COVER</h3>

<p>The people of Luxemburg are not wanting in a
sense of humor. One day an officer of the Prussian
Guard entered a barber shop and had a shave. Whereupon
he tendered to the barber a twopenny piece.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir,” said the barber, “but it’s threepence
now.”</p>

<p>“Why threepence?” asked the Kaiser’s Guardsman.
“In August last you only charged me twopence.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough,” was the barber’s reply; “but
since the Battle of the Marne your face has grown
much longer.”</p>


<h3>WORSE THAN WURST</h3>

<p>They were talking of the war.</p>

<p>“What an age we are living in, to be sure!” said
one.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the other; “it is the German sauce
age.”</p>


<h3>SHE KNEW PADDY</h3>

<p>When a certain Dublin woman was informed a few
days ago that her son had been captured by the Germans
with other prisoners, and that he had been put
into a chain-gang, she said, with great emotion:—</p>

<p>“Heaven help the man that’s chained to our
Paddy.”</p>


<h3>HE HAD SMOKED ONE</h3>

<p>English Host—“I thought of sending some of
these cigars out to the front.”</p>

<p>The Victim—“Good idea! But how can you make
certain that the Germans will get them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>


<h3>SALVAGE</h3>

<p>During the fighting a Highlander had the misfortune
to get his head blown off.</p>

<p>A comrade communicated the sad news to another
gallant Scot, who asked, anxiously:—</p>

<p>“Where’s his head? He was smoking ma pipe.”</p>


<h3>A SOLDIER’S WIFE RELATES THIS</h3>

<p>I received a letter from my husband last week, in
which he states that he and others were having a glass
of beer, when a minister came amongst them and,
kneeling down, began to pray, when one of the company
present, known as “Stammering Tommy,” closed
his eyes and bent his head. When he again opened
his eyes, at the close of the prayer, some one had
drunk up all his beer. “Eh!” exclaimed Tommy, in
astonishment. “M-my b-beer’s all g-gone. I shall
w-watch and p-pray n-next t-time.”</p>


<h3>IT SAID SO ON THE DOOR</h3>

<p>A group of patriotic and very enthusiastic boys
was assembled outside a well-known London hospital.
A passer-by was asked by one of them:—</p>

<p>“Please, sir, can you tell us which general it is who
is in this hospital?”</p>

<p>“General?” replied the man. “I don’t know of any
general in this hospital.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir—look for yourself,” cried all the boys
together.</p>

<p>The man fixed his gaze on the sign and read, “General
Lying-In Hospital.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>


<h3>GENTLE HINT</h3>

<p>A woman who had had four stalwart soldiers billeted
on her endeavored to use as little butcher meat as
possible. Day after day there was served at the dinner
time a scanty meal, the chief item of which was
tea.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she said one day, pointing to a tea leaf
floating in one of the cups, “there’s to be a visitor
today.”</p>

<p>“Well, madam,” said one of the hungry four, “let
us hope that it’s the butcher!”</p>


<h3>SOMETHING JUST AS GOOD</h3>

<p>The number of famous literary men who are now
serving in his majesty’s forces is so great that the
happy idea has been conceived of publishing a book,
the contributors to which are all celebrated authors
who have become soldiers.</p>

<p>Among the long list of names to be found in the
volume, one of the best known is that of A. E. W.
Mason, the novelist.</p>

<p>Formerly Mr. Mason was a member of Parliament,
and he tells of a man who wrote a certain M. P. asking
for a ticket of admission to the gallery of the house
of commons.</p>

<p>The M. P. wrote back saying that he was very
sorry that he could not send the ticket because the
gallery was closed.</p>

<p>The next day he was astonished to receive from the
stranger the following note: “As the gallery is closed,
will you please send me six tickets for the zoo?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<h3>NOT ON THE MENU</h3>

<p>A gentleman in khaki, just back from France,
rambled into a restaurant. After glancing over the
bill of fare, he looked around the room for a waiter.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the waiter, sliding over in response
to his call with a glass of water and a napkin.</p>

<p>“Tell me, waiter,” remarked the soldier, “have you
got frogs’ legs?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the rather unexpected answer; “it
is rheumatism that makes me walk like this!”</p>


<h3>DYE IS SCARCE</h3>

<p>Gen. Joffre’s quiet humor is typified in a story
which comes from the trenches. Some members of the
general’s staff were discussing the number of officers
whose hair had turned from jet black to white since
the war began, and they had decided to their own
satisfaction that the cause was to be found in the
mental strain. Gen. Joffre was asked for his opinion,
and, while agreeing with the conclusion arrived at by
his officers, naively added that it was also very difficult
in war time to obtain the toilet accessories to
which one was accustomed in times of peace!</p>


<h3>THE HERO</h3>

<p>First Tramp—“You seem very ’appy abaht it.
Wot’s up?”</p>

<p>Second Tramp (reading Mr. Asquith’s Guildhall
speech)—“’Ere’s me bin goin’ wivout luxuries all this
time, an’ I’ve only jus’ found out that I’ve bin ’elpin’
the country to win this war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>


<h3>NEEDED A BRACER</h3>

<p>During the recent fighting along the banks of the
Aisne a man was badly wounded. The Ambulance
Corps tenderly placed him on a stretcher.</p>

<p>“Take him to the hospital,” said the man in charge.</p>

<p>Slowly the wounded man opened his eyes and whispered,
faintly:—</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the canteen?”</p>


<h3>AND SMITH COULDN’T DO IT</h3>

<p>Sergeant-Major—“Now, Private Smith, you know
very well none but officers and non-commissioned officers
are allowed to walk across this grass.”</p>

<p>Private Smith—“But, Sergeant-Major, I’ve Captain
Graham’s verbal orders to—”</p>

<p>Sergeant-Major—“None o’ that, sir. Show me
the captain’s verbal orders. Show ’em to me, sir.”</p>


<h3>PAYING HIS RESPECTS</h3>

<p>A soldier had died, and a very unpopular sergeant
was making a “voluntary” levy of a shilling per man
to be sent to the dead soldier’s widow. He came to
Mick, an Irishman, who was always in trouble, and
who hated the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Now, Mick, my man, where’s your shilling?”</p>

<p>Mick slowly put his hand in his pocket, and as
slowly withdrew it. He looked lovingly at the shilling
as it lay in his palm, and then passed it over to the
sergeant.</p>

<p>“There it is,” he said, “and I’d gladly make it a
sovereign if it was for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>


<h3>GOT THE MONEY FIRST</h3>

<p>The following story is vouched for by a well-known
Scottish M. P. somewhere off the East Coast.
A trawler was on naval patrol duty. The skipper
thought he would like some fish for breakfast, so he
commenced operations. Soon up popped a German
submarine close by. The trawler’s skipper, an Aberdonian,
was about to ram it and earn the prize money
when the submarine’s commander, not suspecting this
evil intention, offered to buy some fish. So the canny
Scot went alongside, sold his fish—and then rammed
the submarine.</p>


<h3>FORTUNATE</h3>

<p>Girl (reading letter from brother at the front)—“John
says a bullet went right through his hat without
touching him.”</p>

<p>Old Lady—“What a blessing he had his hat on,
dear.”</p>


<h3>FEMININE STRATEGY</h3>

<p>“I was speaking with your father last night,” he
said, at last, somewhat inanely.</p>

<p>“Oh, were you?” answered the sweet young thing,
lowering her eyes. “Er—what were you—er—talking
about?”</p>

<p>“About the war. Your father said that he hoped
the fighting would soon be over.”</p>

<p>The sweet young thing smiled.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she remarked, “I know he’s very much opposed
to long engagements.”</p>

<p>He took the hint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>


<h3>WAR WORKS WONDERS</h3>

<p>Vicar (who has called to read a letter to one of his
parishioners from her son at the Front)—“Your son,
Mrs. Codling, has been fighting in the trenches. For
a whole week he was standing up to his neck in water!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Codling—“Well, I never! This war be doing
some funny things, sir, to be sure. We couldn’t get
’im to put water anywhere near ’is neck when ’e was
at ’ome!”</p>


<h3>UNLIMITED SUPPLY</h3>

<p>“Do you know, Bill would be awfully helpful to
the Germans at the front.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“They might just get him on to talking about his
fishing exploits when they were filling their gas-bombs.”</p>


<h3>HER DEDUCTION</h3>

<p>Mrs. Brown (to Mrs. Jones, who has been to see a
son off in a troop-ship)—“Well, I’m sure they’ll be
starting soon, for both funnels are smoking; and, you
see, my dear, they couldn’t want both funnels just for
lunch.”</p>


<h3>NOT A FAVORITE BRAND</h3>

<p>Private A—“Wot kind of a cigarette have you
got?”</p>

<p>Private B (handing him one)—“Flor de Kitchener.”</p>

<p>Private A (takes a few puffs and throws it away,
remarking)—“They would floor better men than
Kitchener.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>


<h3>AN UNWILLING TARGET</h3>

<p>The Home Secretary, we understand, can not see
his way to allow a distinguished Anglo-American who
dwells in our midst with his family to exhibit, with
a view to safeguarding his home against Zeppelins, an
illuminated sky-sign bearing the words “Gute leute
wohnen hier” (“Good people live here”).—Punch.</p>


<h3>A COMPROMISE</h3>

<p>In a certain hospital “somewhere in France” one
of the nurses, before going out shopping, was inquiring
of the wounded soldiers whether they required
anything brought in, and, if so, what.</p>

<p>One poor chap asked her to bring him a bottle of
“Scotch.” She told him that was impossible, as he
had been forbidden to drink anything, whereupon
he promptly replied:</p>

<p>“Well, have it frozen, and I’ll bite it.”</p>


<h3>ON A SCOTTISH BATTLEFIELD</h3>

<p>Patriotism is more than name-deep. In the early
summer a tourist party at a Stirling hotel included
an obvious German who had a few months previously
gone the whole hog in the matter of naturalization.</p>

<p>He had called himself—say—Hector McKiltie.
The party strolled out to the field of Bannockburn.
Standing beneath the flagstaff, “McKiltie’s” eyes
beamed through his spectacles for a minute. And
then came the patriotic outburst:</p>

<p>“Mein gracious,” he exclaimed, “so dis vas vere
ve beat der Inglish!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>


<h3>IT HIT HIM FIRST</h3>

<p>The wounded soldier explained his grievance to his
nurse.</p>

<p>“You see, old Smith was next to me in the trenches.
Now, the bullet that took me in the shoulder and laid
me out went into ’im and made a bit of a flesh wound
in his arm. Of course I’m glad he wasn’t ’urt bad.
But he’s stuck to my bullet and given it his girl.
Now, I don’t think that’s fair. I’d a right to it. I’d
never give a girl o’ mine a second-’and bullet.”</p>


<h3>SWEET CHARITY</h3>

<p>Wealthy Benefactress (stopping in at the hospital)—“Well,
we’ll bring the car to-morrow, and take
some of your patients for a drive. And, by the bye,
nurse, you might pick out some with bandages that
show—the last party might not have been wounded
at all, as far as anybody in the streets could see.”</p>


<h3>EXPLAINED</h3>

<p>Eminent Woman Surgeon, Who Is Also an Ardent
Suffragette (to wounded guardsman)—“Do you
know, your face is singularly familiar to me? I’ve
been trying to remember where we’ve met before.”</p>

<p>Guardsman—“Well, mum, bygones be bygones; I
was a police constable.”</p>


<h3>OPTIMISTIC</h3>

<p>Sniper—“I’ve knocked the spike orf ’is bloomin’
’elmet—’e’s took the top orf o’ my bloomin’ ear—and
it’s my shot next!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>


<h3>WHAT STRUCK HIM LEAST</h3>

<p>An Irishman invalided home from the war was asked
by one of his relatives what struck him most about
the battles he took part in.</p>

<p>“What struck me most?” said Pat. “Sure, it was
the large number of bullets flying around that didn’t
hit me.”</p>


<h3>THE TERRIER</h3>

<p>Sergeant—“’Ey, there! Where are you going?”</p>

<p>The Absent-Minded Beggar (who climbed out of
the trench)—“’Oly Jiminy! When that bloomin’
shell whistled over ’ead Hi thought it was twelve
o’clock!”</p>


<h3>MORE THINGS TO KNIT</h3>

<p>“My love, I’ve an idea,” said old Mrs. Goodart
to her caller. “You know we frequently read of the
soldiers making sorties. Now, why not make up a lot
of those sorties and send them to the poor fellows at
the front?”</p>


<h3>A QUALIFIED FIGHTER</h3>

<p>Rather unexpected was the reply of a Mrs. Tommy
Atkins to a lady who inquired if her husband was at
the front.</p>

<p>“Yus,” she said, “an’ I ’ope ’e’ll serve the Germans
as ’e served me.”</p>


<h3>A SHORT CUT</h3>

<p>A stranger inquired of Pat which was the shortest
way to the hospital.</p>

<p>Pat seriously replied: “By shouting three cheers
for Germany.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>


<h3>MORE THAN HE BARGAINED FOR</h3>

<p>A soldier in barracks asked for exemption from
church parade on the ground that he was an agnostic.
The sergeant-major assumed an expression of innocent
interest.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe in the Ten Commandments?”
he asked, mildly.</p>

<p>“Not one, sir!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“What! Not the rule about keeping the Sabbath?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, you’re the very man I’ve been looking
for to scrub out the canteen!”</p>


<h3>AS SEEN IN PRESS REPORTS</h3>

<p>Making the geography lesson as interesting as possible,
the teacher asked the name of one of the Allies.</p>

<p>“France,” cried one little boy.</p>

<p>“Now name a town in France.”</p>

<p>“Somewhere,” promptly returned the youngster.</p>


<h3>BEST OF INTENTIONS</h3>

<p>Young Subaltern:—“I think I ought to get a
periscope; what do you think?”</p>

<p>Grandmamma—“Don’t go buying one, my dear;
if you could borrow one for a pattern, I am sure I
could knit you one just as good.”</p>


<h3>DOUBLE TROUBLE</h3>

<p>“Mein Gott, it iss too much? Ain’t it enough dot
I fight for der Vaterland? Now der Emperor says
we should marry before leaving for der front.”</p>

<h3>HE LOST THE COUNT</h3>

<p>A young officer at the front wrote home to his
father:</p>

<p>“Dear Father—Kindly send me $250 at once. Lost
another leg in a stiff engagement and am in hospital
without means.”</p>

<p>The answer was as follows:</p>

<p>“My dear Son—As this is the fourth leg you have
lost (according to your letters), you ought to be
accustomed to it by this time. Try and hobble along
on any others you may have left.”</p>


<h3>DEADLIER THAN USUAL</h3>

<p>“I understand that all the warring nations find that
women are perfectly able to make shrapnel.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager they make it in their own way, however.
One cupful gunpowder, one cupful nitroglycerin,
a pinch of fulminate, and so on.”</p>


<h3>NEW USE OF THE WORD</h3>

<p>She—“Where have you been?”</p>

<p>He—“In the hospital getting censored.”</p>

<p>She—“Censored?”</p>

<p>He—“Yes; I had several important parts cut out.”</p>


<h3>THE ORIGINAL ONE-STEP</h3>

<p>“Did you ever go to a military ball?” asked a lisping
maid of an army veteran.</p>

<p>“No, my dear,” growled the old soldier. “In those
days I once had a military ball come to me, and what
do you think? It took my leg off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>


<h3>MOTHERLY ADMONITION</h3>

<p>The young organist of the village church had
joined the local corps to fight for King and Country.
The whole place turned out to see the boys go off
to the Front, among them the organist’s mother, a
dear old soul, who was weeping bitterly. Bravely
the old lady dried her tears, and as the train steamed
out of the station she called to her son:—</p>

<p>“Look after yourself, my boy, and be sure you
keep your practice up.”</p>


<h3>OTHER INTENTIONS</h3>

<p>Recruiting Officer—“And now, my lad, just one
more question—are you prepared to die for your
country?”</p>

<p>Recruit—“No, I ain’t! That ain’t wot I’m j’ining
for. I want to make a few of them Germans die for
theirs!”</p>


<h3>SLACKERS</h3>

<p>British Foreman Compositor—“Three more of my
men have enlisted this morning.”</p>

<p>Editor—“Ah! A wave of patriotism, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Foreman Compositor—“Well! Perhaps that’s the
way to put it, but they say they would rather be shot
than set any more of your copy!”</p>


<h3>A PUTTERING PUTTER</h3>

<p>War Fan—“What’de yuh think of von Hindenburg’s
drive?”</p>

<p>Golf Fan—“His drive is all right, but they say
he’s weak on the green.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>


<h3>BLACK AND BLUE, PERHAPS</h3>

<p>The Village Know-All—“’Ow’s that son o’ yourn
wot went into the Army gettin’ on, Mr. Highpate?”</p>

<p>Mr. Highpate—“Oh, doin’ splendid. They’ve
made ’im a color-sergeant now.”</p>

<p>The Village Know-All—“’Ave they, though? What
color?”</p>


<h3>BUT WILL THEY?</h3>

<p>“What makes you think we’ll have better times
when the war is over?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, all these men who do nothing
but stand around discussing the war news will have
time to go back to work.”</p>


<h3>SLOW BUT SURE</h3>

<p>Yoemanry Officer (to trooper whose horse continually
falls to the rear)—“How’s this? You told me
your horse had won half-a-dozen matches against some
of the best horses in the country.”</p>

<p>“So he has, sir,” replied the trooper. “It was in
ploughing matches he took the prizes.”</p>


<h3>THE RECRUIT SCORES ONE</h3>

<p>“Blockhead!” shouted the exasperated drill-sergeant
to the raw recruit. “Are they all such idiots as you
in your family?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the recruit. “I have a brother who is a
great deal more stupid than me.”</p>

<p>“Impossible! And what on earth does this incomparable
blockhead do?”</p>

<p>“He is a drill-sergeant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>


<h3>OUR GUESS WOULD BE BEER</h3>

<p>Teacher—“Now, children, who can tell me which
is the Germans’ favorite drink?”</p>

<p>After a pause—“Champagne,” exclaimed all the
class excepting Tommy.</p>

<p>Teacher—“Now, Tommy, don’t you agree with the
others?”</p>

<p>Tommy—“Well, teacher, I don’t know. I am not
sure that the German army are fond of champagne,
but all the world knows that their navy always stick
to port.”</p>


<h3>A RARE OFFERING</h3>

<p>Scene, improvised singsong in a British relief-camp,
to which a number of German prisoners were
admitted as a special favor. Officer running it returns
after a brief absence to find the sergeant left in control
of the program announcing the following item:
“Our friends Fritz and ’Ans will now oblige with
the ’Ymn of ’Ate.”</p>


<h3>WISE RECRUIT</h3>

<p>Officer (in volunteer camp, to recruit)—“Now, if a
fire should break out, what are you to do?”</p>

<p>Recruit—“Run and find you, sir.”</p>

<p>Officer—“Right. And, if I’m not be found, what
then?”</p>

<p>Recruit—“Put out the fire, sir.”</p>


<h3>BAD BITE</h3>

<p>“Well, I see the Germans have taken Lodz.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bite. Loads of what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<h3>NEVER ARGUE WITH A WOMAN</h3>

<p>A big German officer went into a shop in Brussels
and explained to the old woman inside that Germany
was ever so many times bigger than Belgium.</p>

<p>“How is it, then,” she inquired, “that you can
travel through Germany in three weeks, whereas you
have taken over a year to get through Belgium, and
you are not through yet?”</p>

<p>The officer saluted the old woman and walked away.</p>


<h3>THE WHOLE PACK</h3>

<p>A platoon of a certain regiment, among whom were
a number of men noted as inveterate card-players,
was being drilled. The instructor lined them up and
gave the command:</p>

<p>“Number off!”</p>

<p>Like fire along the front rank ran the response:</p>

<p>“One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, jack, queen, king, ace!”</p>


<h3>NO GARTERS NEEDED</h3>

<p>“Anyhow, there’s one advantage in having a wooden
leg,” said the happy soldier.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” said his friend.</p>

<p>“You can hold your socks up with tin-tacks.”</p>


<h3>WILLING TO SPARE HIM</h3>

<p>“Does your wife show any interest in the war?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. She talks about it.”</p>

<p>“What does she say?”</p>

<p>“Why, she says that she wishes I could go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHANCE FOR SOME INVENTOR</h3>

<p>He—“Why so pensive, my dear? What are you
thinking about?”</p>

<p>She—“I was thinking that if all the yarns husbands
give their wives could be knit up, what a lot
of socks and mittens there’d be for the brave soldiers.”</p>


<h3>IN “ZEPPELIN” TIMES</h3>

<p>“I can’t understand it. A month ago you cut her
dead, and now you can’t make too much fuss over
her.”</p>

<p>“My dear, it’s quite simple. She has the biggest
cellar in the district.”—London Opinion.</p>


<h3>GETTING THE ACCENT</h3>

<p>“My barber is a Frenchman. Every day while he’s
shaving me he gives me a little lesson in French.”</p>

<p>“Fine. But don’t you find it rather difficult to
make replies?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to a certain extent, but the lather that gets
into my mouth seems to help my accent.”</p>


<h3>AN OLD KNITTING STITCH</h3>

<p>It was several days after arriving home from the
front that the soldier with two broken ribs was sitting
up and smoking a cigar when the doctor came in.</p>

<p>“Well, how are you feeling now?” asked the latter.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a stitch in my side all day,” replied the
wounded soldier.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the doctor. “It shows that
the bones are knitting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE DEAR FRIENDS</h3>

<p>At a party Miss Brown had sung “It’s a Long
Way to Tipperary,” and for days after she was singing
or humming it to herself.</p>

<p>“It seems to haunt me,” she said to a friend, who
had also been at the party.</p>

<p>“No wonder,” said the friend. “Look at the way
you murdered it.”</p>


<h3>FIGHTING FOR HIS GLASSES</h3>

<p>A pair of field-glasses “made in Germany” was responsible
for the loss of a trench by the Germans in
circumstances at once laughable and inspiring.</p>

<p>The hero was a young British subaltern who won
the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>The subaltern had a pair of Beiss field-glasses of
which he was extraordinarily proud. He bored everyone
stiff by talking about them continually.</p>

<p>One day his company had been compelled to fall
back on their support trenches owing to a sudden
German attack.</p>

<p>All at once the subaltern shouted “Good heavens!”
and bolted through the communication trench.</p>

<p>A sergeant, who was very fond of the young officer,
went after him, and came back shortly after to the
commanding officer to report:—</p>

<p>“Sir, he has recaptured the trench.”</p>

<p>The commanding officer collected his men, and
again advanced to the fire trench, where he found
the subaltern, with a revolver in each hand, in front
of a whole row of Germans, who had laid down their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
rifles and were holding up their hands. The commanding
officer congratulated him, but pointed out the
recklessness of his action.</p>

<p>“Sir,” replied the subaltern, “I wanted to get my
glasses back.”</p>


<h3>CONCERNED</h3>

<p>Old Lady (to nephew on leave from the front)—“Good-by,
my dear boy, and try and find time to send
a post-card to let me know you are safely back in
the trenches!”</p>


<h3>MOST LIKELY</h3>

<p>Bix—“By the way, who is, or rather was, the god
of war?”</p>

<p>Dix—“I’ve forgotten the duffer’s name, but I
think it was Ananias.”</p>


<h3>TIMID</h3>

<p>Officer (as Private Atkins worms his way toward
the enemy)—“You fool! Come back at once!”</p>

<p>Tommy—“No bally fear, sir! There’s a hornet in
the trench.”</p>


<h3>NOISY TIME-PIECE</h3>

<p>Ship’s Officer—“Oh, there goes eight bells; excuse
me, it’s my watch below.”</p>

<p>The Lady—“Gracious! Fancy your watch striking
as loud as that!”</p>


<h3>IN NAVAL TERMS</h3>

<p>“That is the rhinoceros. See his armored hide?”</p>

<p>“Um. And what’s this?”</p>

<p>“The giraffe.”</p>

<p>“Gee! He’s got a periscope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>


<h3>SO CHANGEABLE</h3>

<p>First Recruit—“What do you think of the major,
Bill?”</p>

<p>Second Recruit—“‘E’s a changeable kind o’ bloke.
Last night I says to ’im ‘’Oo goes there?’ An’ he
says, ‘Friend,’ an’ today ’e ’ardly knows me.”</p>


<h3>AMONG THE MISSING</h3>

<p>Old Lady (to wounded officer)—“Oh, sir, do you
’appen to ’ave ’eard if any of your men at the front
’as found a pair of spectacles wot I left in a 16 ’bus
in the Edgware Road?”</p>


<h3>NO LUCK</h3>

<p>“Do the Germans ever leave anything valuable behind
them in the trenches?”</p>

<p>Veteran—“Never a drop, mum!”</p>


<h3>RECRUITING IN ENGLAND</h3>

<p>Overlooking Blackburn cemetery has been stuck a
great recruiting poster, which reads:—</p>

<p>“Wake up! Your King and Country need you!”</p>


<h3>ALL BUT THE FIG LEAF</h3>

<p>Here is a true story from Paris. A batch of conscripts
were to be examined by the army doctor. The
latter, after seeing that everything was ready in the
room, called out to the soldier attendant:</p>

<p>“Send in the first man.”</p>

<p>The attendant shouted, “Adam!” And in walked
a nude man whose name it was, and who happened to
be the first on the list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<h3>LACKED EXPERIENCE</h3>

<p>The black sheep of the regiment stood before his
commanding officer charged with being drunk. He
stoutly denied the offense, and there was only one
witness, a sergeant, to prove it. However, the records
showed eleven previous convictions for the same
offense.</p>

<p>“You are a hardened and habitual offender,” said
the captain, sternly. “I can’t take your denial against
the sergeant’s word.”</p>

<p>The prisoner turned to the sergeant-witness, and
asked, “Have you ever been drunk?”</p>

<p>On receiving an emphatic negative, he turned to
the captain again.</p>

<p>“Sergeant says I was drunk; I says I wasn’t. I
ask yer, captain, which is likely to be right—him
what’s ’ad no experience of what being drunk is, or
an ’ardened and ’abitual like me?”</p>


<h3>CONDESCENSION</h3>

<p>Modesty is an engaging quality in a young man,
and the British War Office is said to have appreciated
the letter of a youth with no military experience whatever
who, in applying for a commission, stated that
he would be quite willing to start as a lieutenant.</p>


<h3>A HEARTHSTONE HERO</h3>

<p>“I hear, Tommy, you saved a life in the war.”</p>

<p>“Hi did, sir.”</p>

<p>“How did you do it, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“By not hinlisting, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>


<h3>STICKING TO IT</h3>

<p>When the Germans entered Belgium a native of
Liége made himself obnoxious to one troop by his
constant loud talk about the brave defense. Finally
the commander summoned him.</p>

<p>“Now, you’ve boasted about enough,” he said. “We
can’t listen to you any longer. I’m going to give
you your choice: you will be shot, or you will swear
allegiance to the German Emperor.”</p>

<p>Considerably subdued, the offender pondered.
“Well,” he decided, “I don’t want to die, so I guess
I’ll swear allegiance.”</p>

<p>And he took the oath.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the commander, “now you are
one of us. You can come and go as you like.”</p>

<p>The man walked towards the door and was passing
out, when suddenly he turned. “Say,” he exclaimed,
“didn’t those Belgians give us an awful
fight!”</p>


<h3>THE RETREAT FROM ALSACE</h3>

<p>Loquacious Visitor—“So you were wounded at the
front, my good man?”</p>

<p>Irishman—“No, begorry. I was wounded in the
rear av me.”</p>


<h3>TEETH NOT ESSENTIAL</h3>

<p>Medical Officer—“Sorry; I must reject you on account
of your teeth.”</p>

<p>Would-be Recruit—“Man, ye’re making a gran’
mistake. I’m no wanting to bite the Germans; I’m
wanting to shoot ’em.”</p>

<b>BY CARLETON B. CASE.</b></p>

<p>The best bulls, blunders and banter
by the sons and daughters of the Emerald
Isle, gathered into one volume for the
delectation of all who appreciate a hearty
laugh. This is not a mere collection
from the ancient Irish authors, with their
“Handy Andys” and other butts and
jokers, but, in the main, is the best wit
of the modern, the transplanted Irishman,
the kind that Americans best know and
appreciate. You will agree, when you
peruse it, that it is the most mirth-provoking
collection of real good Irish
fun you ever read, and to say that is equivalent
to saying that it is a book of unsurpassed
humor, for the Irishman above
all others “takes the cake” as a natural
wit.</p>

<p>(Edited by Carleton B. Case.) A symposium of
the various ancient and modern methods, as practiced
by Arab Seers and Sibyls and the Romany
Gypsies, with plain examples and simple instructions
that enable anyone to acquire the art with
ease. Divination by cards nowadays is chiefly employed
for amusement and pastime, for entertaining
one’s self or one’s company; at church fairs,
charity bazars and the like. This book supplies all
the data for the complete mastery of this interesting
science, and is the only one in the English language
that is free from technical errors. Just out.</p>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
